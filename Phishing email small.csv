1112,"Hi,Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality. 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.Putting	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18

	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.

Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.>

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.>

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""Owen

Date: Not suppliedCarny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations:     In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country.     ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an 
    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/

' ' traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said . enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445 million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation upon which that german construction , engineering and trading company was built . it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the direction of metals prices . declining market the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading operation . hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to meet demand from its customers . any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring dealer , or floor trader , on the lme . whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' ' the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid slowing economies . the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova scotia to leave the lme ring . the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive electronic trading . german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about $ 100 million . deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount . europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below 100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman for deutsche bank . commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said . dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default , and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek . the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt . enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york ) enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt . enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week , must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products . a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets . ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' ' duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of yesterday . in london , was appointed administrator of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter 11 papers in the u . s . enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value in the last six months . lawyers enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but declined to comment further . chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . thousands affected an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people , including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . recovery the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . shareholders enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
whenever a ""liberal"" enters the room.my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article). Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
 my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and
 discourage left of center postngs. Owen

7300,"sum : dets and number about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english "" the "" , "" some "" , "" john 's "" , as opposed to "" this "" , "" these "" ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n't satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" kucing "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners "" itu "" ( that / the ) and ini "" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . "" seekor kucing itu "" ( that / the one cat ) , "" dua ekor kucing itu "" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with "" itu "" and ini "" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . "" kucing itu "" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" cat "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as "" john 's "" are unmarked for number , eg . "" john 's one cat "" ( john 's one cat ) , "" john 's two cat ( s ) "" ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . "" john 's cat "" ( john 's cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article "" the "" exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by "" the one cat "" , "" the two cat ( s ) "" ) , "" the cat "" is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams .",0

( nyse : ene ) stock sustained further heavy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years . the energy giant ' s stock was off $ 3 . 32 or 11 . 45 percent at $ 25 . 68 per share at mid - day trade on oct . 19 , making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million . as of early morning trading on oct . 22 , enron shares were priced at $ 21 . 99 , a reflection of new developments ( including a new securities and exchange inquiry ) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors . analysis : enron ' s first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company , which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory . while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure , many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron ' s share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role . at the time of skilling ' s departure , enron ' s stock had tumbled to a 52 - week low . however , based on the new 3 q report , it now appears that enron ' s downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company ' s top spot . in essence , enron ' s financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales . it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson - namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company ' s innovation , especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised . the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron , as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission ( sec ) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company . let ' s first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter . as noted , as a whole the company reported $ 638 million in losses , after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges associated with several of its non - core businesses . when we break down the losses , it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses : water , broadband and the retail power market . specifically , enron reported $ 287 million in charges from azurix , its water and wastewater business ; $ 180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations ( including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts ) ; and $ 544 million in what the company is calling "" investment losses . "" evidently , about half of the $ 544 - million figure is related to enron ' s investment in newpower company , the retail electricity and natural - gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm . enron owns 45 percent of newpower . in addition , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent , although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002 . however , it is important to note that enron ' s 3 q recurring net income ( before the write - offs ) did increase 35 percent to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a diluted share , and revenue in the quarter rose to $ 47 . 6 billion from $ 30 billion in 3 q 2000 . the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting . as one of the leading investors in the company , enron drove newpower ' s aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales , despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states . newpower went public last year at an opening price of $ 21 , and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price . however , the company ' s stock has experienced a devastating drop in value , and is currently priced at $ 1 . 25 . newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3 q financial statement until early november , but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future . specifically , newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3 q loss of $ 65 million to $ 70 million , or $ 1 . 12 to $ 1 . 20 a share . third - quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $ 60 million to $ 65 million that the company had forecast in august . in analyzing newpower ' s 2 q financial losses ( see issuealert from 8 / 8 / 01 at www . scientech . com / rci ) , i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states . on the positive side , newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp . and dte energy . these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower , and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states . however , the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen , apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates . this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better , and the company ' s stock has continued to drop as a result . in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes , newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp . and several of its subsidiaries . the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan . 4 , 2002 . with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron , newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset - based financing . however , from enron ' s perspective , the losses associated with newpower ( and , by the same token , the losses in water and broadband ) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price . the message is clear : the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole . further , what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron ' s part has not translated into measurable profits , and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enron ' s stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago . the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique , but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business . further , they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth . the problem with enron ' s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber - optic lines , which has prevented the demand for the division ' s services from materializing as anticipated . the problem with azurix , which has been losing money since its formation in 1998 , is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated . in addition to these problem areas , enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india ( where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government ) and california ( from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales ) . in addition to the losses outlined in the 3 q report , there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week . first , the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding "" certain related party transactions . "" not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry . however , it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow , who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron . ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec ' s request . in a separate development , several mutual funds ( including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron ) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company , which has further weakened enron ' s stock value . portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enron ' s ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader . the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses . thus , lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company ' s energy and gas - pipeline business are still strong . further , lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to "" clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses . "" nevertheless , the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort , and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well . thus , several questions remain at this juncture . are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading ? or , will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002 ? moving forward , will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably ? only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron , which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change . an archive list of previous issuealerts is available at www . scientech . com we encourage our readers to contact us with their comments . we look forward to hearing from you . nancy spring reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day . your company can schedule a sponsorship of issuealert by contacting jane pelz . advertising opportunities are also available on our website . our staff is comprised of leading energy experts with diverse backgrounds in utility generation , transmission & distribution , retail markets , new technologies , i / t , renewable energy , regulatory affairs , community relations and international issues . contact consulting @ scientech . com or call nancy spring at 1 - 505 - 244 - 7613 . scientech is pleased to provide you with your free , daily issuealert . let us know if we can help you with in - depth analyses or any other scientech information products . if you would like to refer a colleague to receive our free , daily issuealerts , please reply to this e - mail and include their full name and e - mail address or register directly on our site . if you no longer wish to receive this daily e - mail , and you are currently a registered subscriber to issuealert via scientech ' s website , please visit to unsubscribe . otherwise , please send an e - mail to to issuealert , with "" delete ia subscription "" in the subject line . scientech ' s issuealerts ( sm ) are compiled based on the independent analysis of scientech consultants . the opinions expressed in scientech ' s issuealerts are not intended to predict financial performance of companies discussed , or to be the basis for investment decisions of any kind . scientech ' s sole purpose in publishing its issuealerts is to offer an independent perspective regarding the key events occurring in the energy industry , based on its long - standing reputation as an expert on energy issues . copyright 2001 . scientech , inc . all rights reserved .",0

6167,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the

http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.

It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than

//-->Type here and click go.July 18, 2002 Dear Readers,
I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

18002,"Hello. I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster,
Am I correct, I hope?Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.
oksana@antee.comPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me 
know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.

the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002

Speech at TTI Vanguard: ""Designing for Resiliency"" 
Conference""911.net""by Bruce Sterling     Late last month I had the joy and privilege
of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer
scientists who were, basically, trying to find some 
reasons to live.    Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've
definitely got some reasons.    When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, 
with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where 
ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, 
well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle 
as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried 
away whenever I witness something like that.  They might 
well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing 
generally requires a reality check from some *other* 
conference.    So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly 
meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are 
my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, 
long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  
And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment 
of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very 
*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very 
hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,
yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  
So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with 
much better shoes.    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just 
deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of 
cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  
I have to report that when I took them my notes from the 
""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was 
bringing the noise.    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws 
drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the 
dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of 
the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the 
Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty 
broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they 
should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* 
stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in 
worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous 
computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this 
is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the 
future.     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all 
right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather 
harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is 
a similarly harsh, dark concept.    ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.   
The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D 
lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has 
been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, 
handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and 
opportunity to get any real-world traction.   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due 
to the events of September 11.  After that experience, 
ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had 
before.  And the means, although they are still 
speculative, are starting to make some sense.    What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?  
Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different 
technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off 
the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically 
impossible.    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are 
the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-
organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, 
embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with 
these things?    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical 
batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, 
power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells 
as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or 
aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; 
just something much, much better than today's batteries.  
Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,
entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously 
advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am 
about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's 
anything wrong with that!)    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have 
some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they 
had some powered processors in them.  Something internal, 
pervasive, a little computational action that is going on 
inside physical objects.    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close 
here.   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously 
underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the 
part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way 
to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The 
problem of the authorized user.  The authorized 
administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to 
play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the 
Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, 
it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected 
from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic 
infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in 
later, they are going to find out that they have 
inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster 
version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike 
information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a 
technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to 
make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our 
sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, 
like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, 
hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been 
there, done that.    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also 
underestimated, for when I started looking at serious 
applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping 
large amounts of physical material in and out of the 
ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, 
numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. 
Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, 
of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed 
fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, 
check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and 
flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self-
assembling networks: networks that are always 
reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.      Facial recognition has a considerable number of 
ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human 
presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware 
suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and 
weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major 
situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, 
environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric 
ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking 
them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from 
earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows 
for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you 
throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept 
here is that we are finally moving computation out of the 
ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the 
1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are 
deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the 
darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. 
That is 911.net.      Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very 
invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial 
design pals said about it, immediately, and they were 
right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for 
ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, 
because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain 
circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this 
issue.    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a 
pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much 
about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really 
want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct 
pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what 
911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its 
way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into 
daylight.       It is an emergency response system for the planet's 
open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are 
more of them all the time.    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp 
has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have 
dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of 
airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in 
airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, 
early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you 
can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital 
objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-
educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically 
under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly 
feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable 
people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some 
other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the 
GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace 
airports serve as political indoctrination centers that 
humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are 
meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of 
governmental clumsiness and general harm.    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that 
airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are 
hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace 
apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of 
nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, 
chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. 
That will hugely increase the overhead of all these 
dangerous industries.     That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though 
Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the 
loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off 
socially or economically in the long run.   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-
deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to 
rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters 
would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are 
already on the ropes.    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and 
remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, 
it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  
Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but 
a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  
Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, 
climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope 
never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social 
re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native 
twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, 
first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good 
for the computer industry.  We all need to take the 
dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This 
week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on 
fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests 
around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, 
spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of 
Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the 
sea. I could go on.    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required 
to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful 
method with which to do this, those useful tactics will 
spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe 
they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net 
will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a 
whole series of ubicomp applications across society.    I've been speculating about these new forms of 
ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because 
that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  
We build little scenario worlds and make up names for 
them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but 
there are others.BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  
Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in 
Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military, 
unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic 
commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I 
haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long 
to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-
understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military 
are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't 
be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily 
growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic 
catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational 
help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick 
and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little 
privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... 
if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it 
might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old 
always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket 
be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  
And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale 
prospects of ""K-12.net.""STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban 
systems management.  Water networks, power networks,
subways, sidewalks and so forth.PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison 
population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be 
watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron 
cages now.INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial 
assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the 
biggest application.SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and 
small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, 
but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety 
zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  
It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a 
sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas 
under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing 
some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into 
various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One 
can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new 
and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in 
the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, 
smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops 
within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, 
sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence 
through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique 
like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might 
be a bit underestimated.And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times 
return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I 
take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  
You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky 
stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in 
a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like 
the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.      When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that 
humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has 
been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of 
ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way 
we deal with them, are different.  Different in character, 
different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century 
standards.     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security 
department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony 
up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my 
lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and 
gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  
This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, 
contemporary idea that is really new, really different, 
and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they 
spread across the board of society. I am going to be a 
very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me, 
send some email.Thanks a lot for your attention.O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O

) : katherine ) woolard . she mentioned that in the california "" official ) english "" push not only were many hispanics in favor of the ) proposed legislation , but so were many supposed liberals in ) the san francisco area . she was doing an analysis of ) discourse in which such liberals justified their positions , ) showing that they were based on hidden assumptions that ) actually ran counter to their claimed liberal beliefs . all this ) points up the fact that oppressed people , with the help of ) their well-meaning supporters , often participate in their own ) oppression . indeed , historical examples indicate that such is ) true even to the point that oppressed groups help organize ) extermination of their own members for oppressing groups . ) so , the results of the polls you cite are not so transparently ) meaningful . a respondent or two drew conclusions from the oft-mentioned hysterical tone of the fundraising materials put out by the "" official english "" movement . my own thoughts on that , as sent to one respondent : on tue , 13 jun 1995 jpkirchner @ aol . com wrote : ) i ' m convinced there is a certain style to fundraising letters ) that crosses the political spectrum , especially since a lot of ) organizations certainly have their letters written by direct ) marketing agencies that are probably not affiliated with any ) particular persuasion . i get such letters from political ) campaigns on the left , right , and in between , including the ) democratic party , and i see absolutely the same nauseatingly > hysterical , hateful style in all of them , as if they were ) written by the same hand . ( which they sometimes may ) have been . ) in one letter , the boogie man is "" liberals who ) want to take away your freedom , "" in another it 's "" advocates ) for the rich who want to make you homeless , "" in another it 's ) immigrants , in a third it 's jingoists . the common ) denominator is always the angry , hateful tone they ' re ) written in . having worked at an ad agency , i know that the ) people in them know their targets , and just how to caress ) them or zing their fillings to get them to act . it has to be an ) established fundraising technique . this whole issue seems to me to be a mix of radical hysteria on both sides , mixed with legitimate questions , which neither side appears willing to address . since linguists , to my experience , are generally terrific at preaching linguistic tolerance , but do n't often deal with pragmatic questions that do n't affect them personally , i ' ll annoy you all with a few questions brought up by non-linguists i know . these people are neither radical conservatives , nor bothered by the use of other languages or dialects in their presence . 1 . how come in us regions where other foreign language groups outnumber hispanics , are safety warnings and federal signage are still only posted in spanish and english ? 2 . a manager , who had previously not minded foreign languages being spoken in the office , is suddenly noticing a lot of discord , backbiting and insubordination among the employees . these are hard enough to quell when everyone is speaking english , but it 's even harder for this manager to monitor what 's happening , because it 's all going on in a foreign language . does the manager a . ) sign up for a beginning language course , b . ) quit the job and give it to someone fluent in the other language , c . ) recruit some of the employees as "" spies "" , d . ) mandate english , e . ) other _ _ _ _ _ ? if the manager mandates english , will it qualify as linguistic intolerance in this case ? 3 . why should a child who speaks black american english be accommodated in the classroom by court order , while an appalachian kid gets forced to learn ( later changed to "" gets the benefit of learning "" ) the standard dialect ( i . e . , in addition to his or her own ) ? 4 . "" the typists in our company are so incompetent at standard english that even a simple business letter takes them at five drafts , and one whole day , to get into acceptable form . it always comes out in their dialect , and it 's much easier for everybody to do their own typing . why can't they give these people english tests ?

Of course they had to do this AFTER we purcahsed these all on vhs, and yes
it is now run by the great evil empire known as disney...but we got the
new School House Rocks DVD anyway and man is it an amazing item.First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Second
off, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,
remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well
worth the 17$ we paid for it.Even if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.Man, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids.

They removed /their/ Java VM. They didn't remove the ability to run Java
programs.
Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As
someone said earlier in the thread, nobody is capable or willing to do that.I've done a bunch of Java and haven't run into huge problems running the

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
YouÂ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!

Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

Date: Not suppliedInterview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like:     Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes.""     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.     RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.tcj.com/247/i_rall.html

"" is a european union funded project ( copernicus ' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g ' eza n ' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401",0

July 17, 2002
						--Robert VamosiSenior Associate EditorCNET Software and Internet Services
Â Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 
						Â 
Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
 The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.
Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in 
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.

4667,"Hi,I'm going to be using MySQL in an upcoming project (and probably
buying their support license), and I'm wondering if anyone else
has used any libraries to link a proprietary C++ project to a
MySQL database. From what I can see on the MySQL website, their
MySQL++ library is under the GPL, but there's also some documents
which list it as under the LGPL.Anyone got any experience with this, or has used a different
library to link C++ and MySQL under Linux?Regards,Vin

Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java, please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of October). There will be a technical and writing test, and interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with others.This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.=================================== * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 ImminentThe second revision will be up on the site soon, at: http://64.78.49.204/The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the beginning of the book.The book is due at the end of October. The print version will appear in December.=================================== * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrowAvailable at: http://64.78.49.204/Chapters 1-4 are finished=================================== * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.

More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings.United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal , a Information-Communication Technology Policy Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector.This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source, e-Government and related fields.Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.See http://www.egovos.org/OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N. ======================Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin of the Information Society Division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science and culture.It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said Dauphin. Check out the sites atUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/) UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/) UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/) UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS ======================Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code (GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtmlMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and related issues.""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid Akhtar told this correspondent.Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects; GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries.CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS ======================In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's the message that governments across India were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector.On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news.GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater . While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95< according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led organizations that LINC serves. ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC explains.LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local support.""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said Slater.To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC Project Linux pages at NEED TO NETWORK ===============Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it. Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community. ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds. -- Frederick Noronha * Freelance Journalist * Goa * India 832.409490 / 409783 BYTESFORALL www.bytesforall.org * GNU-LINUX http://linuxinindia.pitas.com Email fred@bytesforall.org * Mobile +9822 122436 (Goa) * Saligao Goa India Writing with a difference... on what makes *the* difference ########################################################################## # Send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: cola@stump.algebra.com # # PLEASE remember a short description of the software and the LOCATION. # # This group is archived at http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/ # ########################################################################## ------------------------------From: Frederick Noronha Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative] Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMTDear friends,Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.Jeebesh Bagchi sent in this offer recently. It could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ==========The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi (www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of SoftwareSarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs.

5365,"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
mh.Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
spool.I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
look like "">From "".2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
everything works.

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush ViewsBy Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
  |  contain the data for each name of a hard link.  [ ... ] ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-( the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links. I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-( anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb. using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ sorry.  cheers!

11629,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
  marshalling.)- Your idea here.Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl

"" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about "" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like "" cash for used 501 's . "" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . "" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal "" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' "" . witnessing a 501 deal "" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . "" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff "" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) "" . a used - 501 deal "" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for "" used 501s . "" "" 501 "" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a "" major used - 501 deal "" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because "" deal "" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like "" thing "" , a place of business where such transactions take place . "" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction "" "" a major used - 501 deal "" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . "" deal "" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to "" getting a good deal "" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( "" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business "" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for "" a major used - 501 deal "" . 1 . "" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans "" 2 . "" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand "" 3 . "" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans "" "" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . "" can best be paraphrased into : "" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 .

' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb . the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said . according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . "" the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi . "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . "" mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . "" enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . "" mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . "" mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company . "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 ' enron ' s on ! ' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0
5612,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues ""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. ""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

question that started this whole project, ""what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good

writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.â€

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.Owen

Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.Colin.

2055,"that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

  PROBLEMS QUICKER
Â 
When you are fully booked and
overloaded 
  with work there are still the possibility to use theÂ ancient mental 
  working methods, used by successful people,Â instead of the risk for 
  stress and burn out problems.
Â 
These ancient methods for shortening 
  waiting time, adding power to a quicker decision, eliminating stress and
the 
  risk for burn out, are not so commonly used, despite the methodsÂ are 
  known from ancient time.
Â 
The power in the mental working
methods 
  claim for no extra energy consumption so the body will not get tired,
stressed 
  or burn out.
Â 
Please check the web
site:
www.scaninvent.com/mental.methods
Â 
In the compendium I, the
undersigned,Â will 
  reveile and explain my own methods - how I learned them and how I am
training 
  and exercizing them as well as the tactics in converting inner knowledge
to 
  outer reality the speediest way ever known.
Â 
You are most wellcome to study these 
  methods.

1615,"urgent reply . from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon chambers & associates no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria private email address ( @ shymail . com ) dear i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became necessary for me to seek your assistance . i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company ) here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he tendered to the security company while opening the account . therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum given to me confiscate the account . according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my way . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple . i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate that will be required on documentation . first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information : your full names . contact address . telephone / fax numbers . with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking 60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this through . there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary of the estate of my late client . what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you . if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com ) thank you as i await your positive response . barr . arisman shonikon .",1

upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my

Dear Investor,Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest. And that's why we created the Motley Fool Stock

the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking

11135,"q : processing of japanese text / database ; word frequencies i am posting this on behalf of a colleague who is not on the list . she is going to perform psycholinguistic experiments on japanese morphology and needs a number of things for her preparatory work . first of all she needs to find dictionaries or ( preferred ) lexical databases which contain reliable and _ recent _ information on word frequencies ( her main emphasis will be on verb morphology ) ; we already know of one dictionary but this is at least forty years old . can anyone on the list point us to such dictionaries or databases ? - if not , is anyone aware of machine-redable corpora of japanese texts of everyday use ( papers , magazines ) from which she could extract the desired frequencies ? our next problem is to find windows ( truetype or atm ) - fonts of kanj and kana alphabets ( kana would be the more important ) , because these are input to the software that handles the experiments . we are aware of njstar for dos and "" jwp "" , a ' japanese word processor ' for windows , which would suffice as a word processor as such , but it uses an internal font format to which our onversion tool has no access . besides of that having truetype fonts would make building our own databases a lot easier , because we would be able to use windows standard-software , so far we have only been informed of a rather adventurous way of feeding the output of a dos database into njstar to print index cards in a library . by the way - i have heard of a japanese edition of aldus ' pagemaker - does it come with fonts ? we would be grateful for any hint and we promise to post a summary . thanks in advance christian * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * christian kissing dept . of linguistics universitaet duesseldorf home : universtaetsstrasse 1 neusser strasse 17 d-40225 duesseldorf 50670 koeln tel . : + 49 + 211 / 311-4797 0221 / 779061 fax . : + 49 + 211 / 311-5180 email : kissing @ ling . uni-duesseldorf . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",0

Date: Not suppliedA new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
ways to earn a living with it.     Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG...     ""They complain about the Napsters,"" she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. ""But why do 
    the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them.""     Steel said that if the issue ""is not on boardroom table ... then that 
    boardroom has problems.""  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Michael!_)[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=581&e=3&cid=581&u=/nm/20020925/tc_nm/media_kpmg_dc

illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.I'm off to the 
Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeDOWNLOADS
Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE
http://www.thumpbunny.com/Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes 
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to 
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two 
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring 
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no 
swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- 
not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids.

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.Â GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.Buy One Inkjet Cartridge - GET TWO FREE!!

the artist himself are available from this site. You're guaranteed to find 
something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, Von Robert 
Glitschka might even take you on as a client. The portfolio is extensive, 
including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old

down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a 
funny creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is 
accessible by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions.
Â GnomeTIPTraditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.Tip by Jake

( otc : sbgx . pk ) current price : $ 0 . 41 equity structure freetrading 20 , 000 , 000 sharesfloat 3 , 000 , 000 shares overviewstonebridge resources exploration ltd . ( nasd pink : sbgx ) , is a nevada corporation listed on the nasdaq pink sheets . the company is focused on resource acquisition and development for interests located primarily in canada and the united states . the company has begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals , gold and rare earth bearing properties . the company has a strategy to acquire a large number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing immediately . the initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for moving into production and produce substantial income and profits . a private funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the properties and equity in the company . value resources has a highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource property development . the target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has a diverse and robust mix of deposits , some of very high value . one target acquisition , for example , has a large deposit of scandium . scandium is a very expensive rare earth material which has been used by the russian materials industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft . currently there is no scandium mined in the free world , and the property that stonebridge plans to develop contains large reserves of scandium and titanium . the company plans to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper , gold , zinc , talc , platinum and palladium amongst others . stonebridge has an initial plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties within a very short timeframe . in the next several months sbgx plans to control at least a dozen high - value mining properties with the potential to bring in many millions of dollars of profit to the company . the exact extent of the potential revenues is as yet undermined because , although most of the candidate properties have known reserves , more exploration and drilling needs to be conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once acquisition is complete . even after exploration , the potential exists to uncover undiscovered reserves with the potential to multiply the known value of the candidate acquisitions . one target acquisition is about 10 kilometers southwest of timmins , ontario . the property already has indicated probable reserves of 100 , 000 ounces with grades of 0 . 3 ounces per ton . this medium grade ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit . exploration is ongoing at the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for development once the acquisition is completed . the company has a strategy to develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests . this strategy allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly on all properties simultaneously . the company has at least ten gold bearing sites under review for acquisition at this time . resources is building a large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in various stages of development . the strategy of developing diverse properties with various types of rare earth , gold and mineral deposits insures that there is robust and lasting value built into the company . moreover the chances of uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and extent of the deposits become fully known . stonebridge plans to develop these properties and get them into production as soon as possible . the company is well funded by investors who care for the long - term viability of the company and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders . gmcr expects that stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the development of these initial candidate properties . moreover , gmcr expects that the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major mining concern throughout north america . press release stonebridge signs loi to acquire 50 % interest in mining claims of 6070205 canada inc . friday april 29 , 4 : 01 pm et carson city , nev . - - ( business wire ) - - april 29 , 2005 - - stonebridge resources explorations ltd . ( nqb : sbgx - news ) , has entered into a letter of intent with 6070205 canada inc . to acquire 50 % interest in the mining claims of their property in northern ontario , 15 km n . w . of kirkland lake . the property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large sulphite deposit . the initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number of drill holes , varying from 0 . 6 meters of 4 . 4 % zinc and 1 . 76 % zinc over 4 . 6 meters , 1 . 33 % zinc over 4 meters . in the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property identifying several areas of interest . a confirmation of the geophysical result from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling . it was recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken . harold pizel , stonebridge resources president , said ; "" this agreement signed once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich northern ontario region , we are excited about the opportunities ahead .

Hash: SHA1Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).        green   This is probably not spam.spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.- --Michael

Â Dear Readers,
If the best things in life are free, why does software cost so
much? Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was
the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your
software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for
free. Now, even Yahoo is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client.
But if you look closely enough, you can still find some
worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed four free e-mailers to get you started. And we've also
taken a peek at the new BearShare, which is not only
free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no
cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is
another matter entirely.                                                Â Intel's new insides: one size fits all?The i845 chipset's many flavors are faster, better, and a lot more confusing. Read before you shop.

Roundup: CNET reviews four free Web e-mailers
Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
   dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called
   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as
   before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another
   look at so-called ""free"" e-mailers.
   Get the gear you need to burn DVDs
DVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but
   picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task.
   We've broken down the process and selected the best gear
   for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player.
   
BearShare 4.0
The latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client
   lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a
   nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus,
   BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware
   when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear
   to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why.Read the reviewÂ |Â Manufacturer priceYahoo MailÂ  
After months of beta testing and pricing adjustments (that's right, Yahoo now charges for some services), the new Yahoo Mail just hit the Web. Among its changes are a complete redesign, better Calendar and Address Book integration, and a new color palette. Find out if Yahoo still deserves your account.Read the review
Peachtree Complete Accounting 2003
For years, Peachtree has provided professional accounting to

   array of Web tools for creating and maintaining an online
   store. What's new in 2003?Read the reviewÂ |Â Check latest pricesFirst Take: ICQ Lite Alpha
  
 One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its
   bloated feature set. Now, the company has released a new
   ""lite"" ICQ that sucks up far less system memory than the
   full-fat version--but at what cost? We take a first look. SBC Yahoo Dial
 
 Thanks to a partnership with SBC Pacific Bell, Yahoo is now
   in the dial-up game. The new service, known as SBC Yahoo
   Dial, offers a customized browser, 25MB of storage, and 11
   e-mail addresses--all for $21.95 or lower, depending on
   your SBC service package. Our reviewer investigates.Read the reviewFirst Take: Winamp3 Release Candidate   We've been waiting aeons for the newest version of popular
   media player Winamp. We haven't received a full new version
   yet, but AOL has partially obliged with a prerelease

   and some major underlying changes. But does the new look
   muddy up Winamp's legendary ease of use?
Inside @ccess: Is your ISP safe from hackers?

 Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops
   up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s)
   from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have
   QuickTime set as your default media player for all media
   files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date,
   whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply
   upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade
   feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit >
   Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled
   ""Check for updates automatically.""
	   
   If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player,
   open that program, click Tools > Options. Select the Formats
   tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that
   you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that
   QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those
   file types within QuickTime.

11741,"I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
loaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
browser.""===
""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
applications.""""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
for the file.""

16735,"english snow words jonathan david bobaljik posted a message to vol . 5-1276 of this list in which he discusses the various yup ' ik words for snow that have been contributed by anthony woodbury . for the sake of comparison he has a list of 9 or 10 english words for snow and snow-like things . i thought it would be useful to find out whether each of these english words means _ primarily _ snow or whether the snow sense is derived , figurative , or otherwise secondary . i have consulted the various editions of the oxford english dictionary . my results are as follows : a . acceptable cases : 1 . snow : a good english word with a respectable pedigree . means primarily snow . 2 . sleet : also good . by the way , is there an eskimo term corresponding to this ? 3 . slush : also good . 4 . avalanche : this word seems to have referred to snow avalanches from the beginning . 5 . blizzard : the first edition of the oed says , "" a modern word . . . . as applied to a 's now-squall , ' the word became general in the american newspapers during the severe winter of 1880-81 ; but according to the _ milwaukee republican _ = ff 4 march 1881 , it had been so applied in the _ northern vindicator _ ( esthersville , iowa ) between 1860 and 1870 . it was apparently in colloquial use in the west much earlier . . .

"" ) but it clearly has too many other related senses , such as "" off-course movement of a boat "" and "" gist of what someone is saying . "" drift is related to "" to drive "" . compare bobaljik 's discussion of yup ' ik _ natquik _ 'd rifting snow ' . 4 . flurry : this word means primarily ' gust ' or 's quall ' . washington irving is cited in 1836 talking about "" flurries of snow "" , but there are other cases of flurries of rain , birds . conclusion : not primarily a snow word . 5 . sinkhole : bobaljik rejects _ muruaneq _ 's oft , deep snow ' , offering "" sinkhole "" as roughly comparable ( and presumably also unacceptable ) . = 20 "" sinkhole "" is not in the oed . my understanding of a sinkhole is any depression in which liquid collects , especially in the ground . i do not think it has anything to do with snow per se . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * c . special case : 1 . frost : i have left "" frost "" out of the english list , since it has more to do with frozen dew and ice than with snow . i have also omitted "" rime "" and "" hoarfrost "" ( "" hoar "" is figurative for old age ) . accordingly , i urge that words for frost be omitted from the eskimo lists . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * d . conclusion : my count is 5 good english words whose primary meanings are snow or forms of snow . bobaljik also allows only 5 "" exclusively snow-related simple roots "" in yup ' ik ( excluding "" frost "" as explained above ) . i am not a specialist in english etymology , but i am experienced at using the oed . is _ muruaneq _ 's oft , deep snow ' really not a purely snow word , as bobaljik says ? i would also like to know what "" eskimo "" languages there are other than yup ' ik for which snow-words are recorded in detail . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 = 09 = 09 = 09 = 09 < charmii @ u . washington . edu >",0

The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

With rebates, HP angles for PC sales 
Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay 
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss 
Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73%

Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02 
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99%

continue to have the Pick results, not the new folder contents.
If you go to a any folder and do Rescan, then it heals itself.

Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. â€œTrying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.â€ I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS controlâ€”also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI

open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

  |  There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
  |  available.  [ ... ]  This information is also shown by ls -lc, but
  |  parsing ls' output requires a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend
  |  [ writing ] a short C program to access the file status directly,
  |  and output the ctime directly (seconds since the epoch, i.e. perfect
  |  |  for numerical comparison). some systems have a stat(1) tool --- don't think it's GNU --
 which, when given the `-t' option, does exactly what Lars is
 suggesting:   $ stat -t /etc/motd
   /etc/motd 21 8 81a4 0 0 303 79 1 0 0 1028070983 830730492 1013296719 minor problem is the `-t' format is not actually explained in
 the man page, but its fairly easy to work out (or you can just
 look at the source).  also, since the filename is printed as
 the first ""field"", bizarre filenames (e.g., ones which contain
 spaces or newlines) can confuse a simple script.cheers!

4587,"review : torrego , the dependencies of objects . torrego , esther , ( 1998 ) , the dependencies of objects . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 . cambridge , massachusetts : the mit press . 197 pages . reviewed by alex alsina , universitat pompeu fabra ( barcelona ) . this book is a study of overtly case-marked objects in spanish that pays attention to similar phenomena in other languages , particularly other romance languages . it is well-known that direct objects , or accusative objects , in spanish , when expressed as full nps , or dps ( to use the author 's term ) , alternate between two forms depending on various semantic and syntactic properties : dps withouth any overt case morphology , and overtly case-marked dps . the overt case marker in question is the preposition "" a "" , which also marks dative objects . the study adopts the minimalist program , outlined by chomsky ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) , as a framework for developing an analysis for the various phenomena under investigation . synopsis chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework of the book and sketches the content of the subsequent chapters . chapter 2 presents the various generalizations that characterize spanish accusative objects marked by the dative preposition . among these generalizations are correlations between overt case-marking and specificity , between overt case-marking and telicity , between overt case-marking and an interpretation of the subject as an agent or a cause , etc . the common element in the explanation of all of these generalizations is the idea that the marked accusative object raises overtly to a position outside vp , to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes the vp as its complement . for example , the two following facts are observed : marked accusative requires ( or may require ) a telic interpretation of the event which is absent with unmarked accusative objects , and an affected interpretation of the ( animate ) object requires overt case-marking on the object . it is suggested that objects moved outside the vp have a delimiting role for their predicates and , at the same time , the position to which objects moved , the spec of vp , is the locus of affectedness . thus , two different properties of overt case-marking would be made to follow from the idea that overtly case-marked objects in spanish undergo overt movement to spec of vp . likewise , the observation that overt case-marking on the object requires the subject to be interpreted as an agent or as a cause is linked to the idea that an overtly case-marked object is in spec-v p and to the hypothesis that the causative or agent role is assigned to the v - vp configuration . torrego proposes that there are two types of marked accusatives , one with structural case and the other with inherent case . marked accusative is inherent with causative and agentive verbs and those with affected objects , and is structural with other verbs . this theoretical difference is appealed to in order to account for an asymmetry with respect to extraction out of marked accusative objects : such extractions are ill-formed with the former class of verbs , but not with the latter . the presence of the extra structure created by the inherent case marker is a crucial element in the explanation of this contrast . chapter 3 examines variation in causative structures in spanish and argues that this variation is largely conditioned by case assignment . much of the discussion is based on a causative structure in which the causee appears between the causative verb "" hacer "" ' make ' and the infinitive . one of the goals of the chapter is to explain the restrictions on the "" faire-par "" causative in several spanish dialects . in these dialects , the "" faire-par "" causative is only fully acceptable in the following situations : ( 1 ) when an object clitic is present , or ( 2 ) when a reflexive clitic is present , and that , otherwise they are best with verbs identified as "" constructive accomplishments "" such as ' build ' or with case-marked objects . chapter 4 analyzes constructions with dative objects , both with ditransitive verbs and with unaccusatives . restrictions regarding constructions with two objects with identical case-marking are examined . the chapter also deals with contrasts between the presence and absence of doubling clitics . a comparison is made with the double object constructions in english . an analysis is presented of the contrast in raising constructions with 's eem ' between those without the dative argument ( acceptable ) and those with it ( unacceptable ) . conclusions are briefly summarized at the end . critical discussion this book is a mine of linguistic puzzles concerning objects , causative constructions , clitics , and related phenomena in spanish . it is of interest to anyone concerned with these matters , regardless of what analysis and what theoretical framework one may wish to adopt . this book is also of interest to linguists who want to find out how the minimalist program can be applied to a particular empirical domain . the author has done a great job of synthesizing the data and presenting generalizations that need to be explained . despite these positive aspects of the book , i experienced serious frustrations while reading it having to do with the data and with the analysis . data the problem with the data , which is a minor one compared to the other one , has to do with the fact that many of the data presented are alien to the varieties of spanish that i speak or am familiar with . naturally , i cannot claim to know all varieties of spanish , so i should not be surprised to discover data that do not belong to the spanish that i know . some examples follow . torrego presents a contrast in pp . 58-59 between "" a quienes ( les ) vieron ? "" and "" a quienes ( * los ) vieron ? "" , but both forms are equally ill-formed for me when the clitic ( the form in parentheses ) is included . the example "" la guerra los hizo subir "" in page 101 is claimed to allow only an animate reading for the clitic "" los "" , although for me it also allows an inanimate reading , but then this fact is claimed to hold only in spanish dialects where the pre-infinitival causee with "" hacer "" and an intransitive verb is attested , and i find this causative structure highly marginal ( examples such as "" la maestra hizo a los alumnos subir "" ) . and the construction exemplified by sentences such as "" me hizo pedir yo , "" which is analyzed in this book , is also alien to me . the main problem with these numerous discrepancies about the data is that it makes it hard to evaluate when a difference in the interpretation of the data is due to a difference in the data ( that may not be obvious ) or to a possible misanalysis of what actually is the same data . to illustrate this , consider the argument given in support of the claim that the structure embedded under "" hacer "" in a sentence like "" la guerra hizo subir los precios "" is a single unit ( p . 102 ) . torrego claims that standard constituency tests indicate that the sequence "" subir los precios "" in this sentence is a constituent and provides examples such as the following in support of this claim : ( 38 ) a . lo que la guerra hizo es subir los precios . what the war caused is to rise the prices d . que ha hecho la guerra sino subir los precios ? what has the war caused except rising the prices ? for me the translation of these sentences is not as indicated in the glosses , but rather as "" what the war did is to raise the prices . "" and "" what has the war done but raise the prices ? "" for ( 38a ) and ( 38d ) respectively . i would tend to believe that torrego is playing on the polysemy of "" hacer "" and "" subir "" . "" hacer "" can be either the causative verb meaning ' cause ' or ' make ' or the generic transitive verb translatable as 'd o ' , and "" subir "" can be either intransitive , equivalent to ' rise ' , or transitive , equivalent to ' raise ' . for the examples in ( 38 ) to be relevant to torrego 's claim , "" hacer "" must be causative and "" subir "" intransitive . what makes these exemples acceptable ( even though not perfect ) for me is that "" subir "" can be taken to be a transtive verb , whose unexpressed subject is coreferential with "" la guerra "" . but , under this interpretation , "" hacer "" would not be functioning as the causative verb , but as the counterpart of 'd o ' . what shows conclusively that , in my variety of spanish , this interpretation is right is that , if , instead of "" subir "" , we use a verb that only has an intransitive use , we get an unacceptable result . "" caer "" ' fall ' is such a verb : even though the sequence "" caer los precios "" can appear following the causative verb "" hacer "" , as in "" la guerra hizo caer los precios , "" it cannot appear as a focused or topicalized constituent of this verb , as we see in ( i ) . ( i ) a . * lo que la guerra hizo es caer los precios . what the war did / caused is to fall the prices b . * que ha hecho la guerra sino caer los precios ? what has the war done / caused except falling the prices ? > from this i would conclude that torrego 's data in ( 38 ) do not provide any evidence for the claim that a sequence such as "" subir los precios "" in a causative construction is a constituent , because those examples do not include the causative verb "" hacer "" . of course , i can only reach this conclusion for the variety of spanish that i am familiar with , where ( i ) is ungrammatical . but , for all i know , the examples in ( i ) could be grammatical in the variety of spanish analyzed by torrego , in which case my conclusion would not apply and the examples in ( 38 ) would constitute relevant evidence for the claim under investigation . analysis my second difficulty with this book is in the analysis ( or analyses ) provided . i have trouble understanding many of the analyses given : in many cases , i fail to derive the predictions that should follow from the analysis , i cannot tell what would constitute a counterexample to the analysis , i cannot figure out what role a given assumption plays in the analysis , etc . this could well be due to a deficiency on my part , but other readers might experience the same difficulties . next , i will point out some problem cases . 1 . chapter 2 of the book starts out with a list of six generalizations about marked accusative ( pp . 14-16 ) : ( 1 ) marked accusative can cooccur with doubling clitics in some dialects ( it is a necessary condition for clitic doubling ) , ( 2 ) marked accusative objects are interpreted as specific , ( 3 ) telicity requires marked accusative ( with animate objects ) , ( 4 ) the subject in a clause with a marked accusative object is an agent or a cause , ( 5 ) marked accusative is restricted to animates , and ( 6 ) affected animate objects require marked accusative . the indications given all along are that these generalizations will follow from a unified analysis . the main idea underlying this analysis is that an object with marked accusative raises to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes a vp as its complement . ideally , an overt movement operation of this kind should have some testable effects on word order and all of the properties of the construction should follow straightforwardly from this operation . however , as torrego notes , there is no visible effect of object raising on word order , so that the motivation for the analysis rests entirely on how well it explains the generalizations listed above . and these generalizations are explained by attributing the various properties that correlate with overt case-marking to the spec of v - vp position on a one-by - one basis . for example , it is proposed that the spec of v - vp has a specific interpretation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp may shift the aspect of the predicate to a telic situation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp gives an agentive interpretation to the subject , etc . one wonders why this analysis should be preferable to one that attributes all of these properties directly to overt case-marking : in both cases , a one-by - one stipulation of those properties is required . it is not clear what the advantage is in attributing these properties to a special phrase structure position for which very weak evidence is given . 2 . in pp . 23 ff , torrego claims that there are two types of marked accusative : marked accusative of non-affected objects is structural case , whereas marked acusative of affected objects is inherent case . however , this claim is faced with a major problem that torrego notes , but then simply disregards . inherent ( or quirky ) case has the generally accepted property that it is preserved under passivization : an argument with inherent case does n't lose or change its case marking when its clause is passivized . genitive and dative case in icelandic are a good example of this , and dative case in spanish is also a good example of case marking that does not change from active to passive . however , the marked accusative case of affected objects in spanish is not preserved ( see relevant examples in p . 28 ) . torrego notes that , in contrast with spanish , some hindi dialects preserve the accusative "" - ko "" marking in passives , citing mohanan 1990 . torrego then goes on to say ( p . 29 ) : "" if the marked accusative of "" affected "" objects were inherent , overt marking in passivization could be preserved ( just as the marking of datives and genitives is preserved in icelandic passives ) . it remains to be seen whether relevant data from the dialects of hindi confirm this expectation . "" but the relevant data from the dialects of hindi does confirm this expectation , as the examples from mohanan 1990 ( also mohanan 1994 ) show . if we agree that we identify inherent case because its case marking is preserved under passivization , then we must conclude that marked accusative case is inherent in some dialects of hindi , because its case marking does not change under passivization , but is structural in the other dialects of hindi , where it does change under passivization . and we are forced to conclude that it is structural in spanish because it is not preserved under passivization . to ignore this evidence and still conclude that marked accusative case can be inherent case in spanish is to devoid the distinction between structural case and inherent case of the conceptual and empirical substance that it is standardly asociated with . and torrego does not explicitly reject this association . 3 . the agentivity effect of clauses with marked accusative is explained as follows : following a suggestion of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) , the causative or the agent role can be understood as the interpretation assigned to the v - vp configuration ; since marked accusative is assigned to objects that raise to spec of vp , the presence of marked accusative implies the existence of the v - vp configuration . therefore , whenever there is marked accusative , there must be an agentive or causative interpretation . but what happens with verbs that allow an alternation between marked and unmarked accusative on the object ? this should mean that such verbs should alternate between a v - vp configuration and some other configuration , but this second option is not spelled out . also , we have no way of knowing what consequences the presence or absence of the v - vp configuration has other than on overt case marking and on the corelation between overt case marking and other properties such as agentivity . 4 . in pp . 34 ff . , torrego tries to relate the idea that marked accusative on affected objects is lexical quirky case to grimshaw 's ( 1990 ) theory of quirky case - marking . in grimshaw 's theory , arguments at argument structure are ranked by prominence in two tiers : the aspectual tier and the thematic tier . adopting this theory , torrego proposes ( p . 36 ) that "" an argument ( subject or object ) can be lexically or quirky marked when it has thematic or aspectual prominence relative to the other argument . "" it is unclear how one is to interpret this proposal . prominence is a comparative property : a is more or less prominent than b . to say that a has prominence relative to b is either meaningless or would be true of any pair of arguments in an argument structure : it is necessarily true of any pair of arguments a and b of an argument structure that a is in a prominence relation to b . torrego goes on to state : "" the two arguments of an agentive telic transitive verb are both aspectually prominent . "" but this should be true of all transitive verbs . torrego goes on to conclude : "" this approach covers the fact that the object of only agentive and caustive verbs can or must be lexically or quirky case - marked , and also covers the fact that the overall phenomenon of marked accusative case happens with verbs that have agentive subjects . "" i fail to see how these predictions are derived . 5 . regarding the animacy restriction on overtly case - marked objects , torrego proposes that the term "" actor "" is more appropriate to characterize the class of nominals that appear in marked accusative than the term "" animate "" . the motivation for this terminological change is found in the existence of some expressions denoting inanimate entities that can take overt case - marking , as in the following example ( p . 55 ) : ( 45 ) el acido afecta ( a ) los metales . ' acid affects metals . ' ( i suspect that the presence of marked accusative in this example has more to do with the verb than with the semantics of the object . ) torrego does not propose a definition of "" actor "" , but refers the reader to jackendoff 's ( 1983 ) characterization of "" actor "" as the character in an action-type event that performs the action . given this characterization , it is hard to see how "" los metales "" ' the metals ' in example ( 45 ) can be interpreted as the argument that performs the action of the event ; what would "" el acido "" ' the acid ' be , then ? torrego goes on to say : "" the distinction between "" animates "" ( or "" actor "" - like nominals ) and "" inanimates "" does not appear to be semantic in nature . "" this is an odd claim to make , given that the notion of "" actor , "" which is proposed to replace "" animate , "" is given a semantic characterization . the motivation for this claim , however , is found in the fact that certain expressions , specifically proper names of humans , can be used to refer to anything , from a boat to a magazine to a can of beer , and always require overt case morphology , as in the following example : ( 46 ) esconde * ( a ) barbara . ' hide barbara . ' it is suggested that a purely morphological property underlies overt case - marking , although no indication is given as to what this morphological property might be . possibly the most robust generalization about overt case - marking of objects in spanish is that it is restricted to "" animates "" , even though there are problem cases such as example ( 45 ) and "" personified "" expressions such as ( 46 ) . because of these problems , torrego gives no explanation for the correlation between case - marking and animate interpretation and between absence of case - marking and inanimate interpretation that we see in pairs such as ( ii ) and ( iii ) : ( ii ) a . esconde a este . ( ' hide this one ( male animate entity ) . ' ) b . esconde este . ( ' hide this one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) ( iii ) a . veremos a otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( female animate entity ) . ' ) a . veremos otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) general remarks torrego often appeals to intuition in the exposition of the analysis and does not work out the details of the analysis . the following remark , very reminiscent of chomsky 's style , illustrates this point ( p . 139 , end of 3rd par . ) : "" whatever the details of this intuitive account are , the general approach seems quite plausible . "" if one does not work out the details of an account , it is not possible to derive predictions from it , and therefore the theory is unfalsifiable . this work by torrego is part of a move towards deriving explanations from very general and simple principles that interact in complex ways with each other . this move is a welcome one , but we should be careful that it does not land us in vagueness and imprecision . there is a style of explanation in which appeal is made to principles , often unstated or imprecisely stated principles , from which predictions are claimed to follow , but in which the derivation of predictions ( the logical steps from which predictions follow ) is not worked out and it is not possible to know what a prediction of the theory really is and what a counterexample to the theory might be . there is a danger that a reader of torrego 's "" the dependencies of objects "" might have the impression that the explanations in this book are of this style . to prevent this impression , torrego should have made a greater effort in terms of exposition ( even if it means leading the reader by the hand ) to show how the various predictions are derived . for that , it is necessary to state the crucial principles explicitly , as numbered items so the reader can refer to them easily , to make the assumptions about representations also explicit , and to give step-by - step derivations of the various predictions . references chomsky , noam . 1992 . a minimalist program for linguistic theory . mit working papers in linguistics , no . 1 . chomsky , noam . 1994 . bare phrase structure . mit occasional papers in linguistics , no . 5 . chomsky , noam . 1995 . the minimalist program . mit press . grimshaw , jane . 1990 . argument structure . mit press . jackendoff , ray . 1983 . semantics and cognition . mit press . mohanan , tara . 1990 . arguments in hindi . ph . d . dissertation , stanford university . mohanan , tara . 1994 . argument structure in hindi . stanford : csli publications . reviewer : alex alsina , professor titular d ' universitat , faculty of translation and interpretation , universitat pompeu fabra , barcelona , spain . ph . d . , stanford university , 1993 . research interests include syntax , morphology , morphosyntax , argument structure , linguistic theory . reviewer 's address : alex alsina facultat de traduccio i interpretacio universitat pompeu fabra la rambla , 30-32 08002 barcelona spain alex . alsina @ trad . upf . es",0

"" sources gathered the following information on plan b through private interviews with california legislatures sen . john burton and assembly speaker robert hertzberg . speaker robert hertzberg : ? speaker hertzberg has spent most of his time lately on the budget , but continues to make efforts related to the plan b . hertzberg is very aware how unlikely it is that he will succeed in putting any plan through the legislature , particularly the senate .

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packagesDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.MatthiasPS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer ""freshrpms.net!"" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))--

I would claim they're considerably more promiscuous on the average than
your average het. My utterly unscientific, unsubstatiated claim is that
the typical male would *like* to be considerably more promiscous than your
average female (ay, and here's the rub. pray don't forget the kleenex).  
Look up different reproduction strategies, due to basic hardware
difference (sexual dimorphism). You'd do that too if it happened to you.Once you go past the first three of four pages of hysterical propaganda on
Google you might actually run into real studies. Anyone game? I have to 
work (well, pretend to).

11867,"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Spambook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Spambook! Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. 
Keep the bad guys
out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: 
ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends
your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. 
Click here to download now!   As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a startling revelation that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clarkhttp://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Sorting IP Addresses Via Script
http://www.i386.com/Default.asp?page=docs/scripting-ip2long.htm&category=admin&id=1046
Documentation is everything. If you have a handle on your 
network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP 
addresses are one bit of information that must be properly 
tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort 
data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief 
article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, 
perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted 
decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided 
to get you started.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown
http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html
Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?Virtual Sketching
Discovered by Dianahttp://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2mfh8/
I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box 
somewhere. Maybe I should dig it back out and webify the 
thing just for grins. Check out this example of novelty web 
programming, assuming y'all don't kill the site. If it's 
down, check back later. Using a web form, you can enter the 
moves you'd like to see represented on the pad, which is 
viewed through a live webcam. I'd love to see someone craft 
the Lockergnome logo. Impress me...

11549,"$ 7 money maker and e - mail service please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed ! ! ! ! a ) immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the seven people listed below . wrap the dollar in a note ( typed or handwritten ) saying please add me to your mailing list and include your name , mailing address , and e-mail address . your phone number is optional . 1 - lbm enterprises 167 hamilton st . oceanside , ca 92054 2 - cms cybermart po box 153 linden , tx 75563 3 - kln 6719 s . 109th e ave . tulsa , ok 74133 4 - w . f . h . po box 774 butler , nj 07405 5 - m . bird 658 shenandoah ave . san marcos , ca 92069 6 - mtc 15 hartack ct . baltimore , md 21236 7 - jtk po box 21177 st . petersburg , fl 33742-1177 b ) remove the name next to # 1 at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position . then place your name in the # 7 spot . this is best done by saving this to a file and entering in your information on line # 7 . be very careful when you type the addresses and proof read them . c ) when you have completed the above instructions you have options of mailing your new letter in two ways : 1 ) through us postal service or 2 ) through e - mail . this letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above instructions , because you are purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list . to mail this out over the internet , you could browse through areas and find people to send this to all the time . all you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses wherever you are on the internet . remember , it doesn t cost anything to mail on the internet . or you can use a mass e - mail network to mail it out in large volumes for you . we highly recommend this one . they always e-mail more than the amount you purchase and their addresses are fresh . e - mail this letter to them with your name and address in position # 7 above . call this bulk e-mail company now ! they have the lowest rates on the net . they are fast , give effective returns and provide excellent service . ( 760-430 - 1067 ) * * you will want to e-mail this to as many people as you can . this will bring you big payoffs . this company has been most effective for this program . * * * keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of names you could send out . the more names you send the more money you will make . we strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family and friends and relatives as well . * * * this is a service and is 100 % legal ! ! ! ( refer to title 18 , section 1302 & 1342 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws ) assume , for example , you get a 7 . 5 % return rate , which is very conservative . my first attempt was about 9 . 5 % and my second time was over 11 % . 1 ) when you mail out 200 letters , 15 people will send you $ 1 . 00 2 ) those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people send you $ 1 . 00 3 ) those 225 people mail out 200 letters and 3 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 4 ) those 3 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 50 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 5 ) those 50 , 625 people mail out 200 letters and 759 , 373 people send you $ 1 . 00 6 ) those 759 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 11 , 390 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 at this point your name drops off the list . think about it . with only the first six levels you have received over $ 813 , 615 . 00 ! ! ! it works every time , but how well depends on how many letters you send out . in the example above , you mailed out 200 letters ; if you mailed out 500 letters , you would have received over $ 2 , 006 , 917 . 00 . check the math yourself . i want you to , but i guarantee it is correct ! ! with this kind of return , you ve got to try it . try it once and you will do it again - - guaranteed ! ! ! just make sure you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list . together we will all prosper ! ! ! p . s . you ve read this far , so let me ask you one simple question . q : what have you got to lose ? a : only $ 7 . 00 what you can gain is an income , like the example in this letter . very small risk . very small expense . huge potential returns ! ! ! what do you really have to lose ? i invite you to join our mailing list today ! ! wishing you happy success and an excellent1998 . p . p . s we have a 95 % return at this point ! ! ! if you need a company to send out bulk e-mails for you call cyber bulk at 760-460 - 1067 . they provide an excellent service and have the lowest prices on the net ! !",1

12345,"> Someone tell me a joke, or email me a beer or something...A man is out driving in the country, and drives past a farm with the most
beautiful pig -- fat, healthy, pink, clean, etc. Just a lovely pig. He gets
out to admire the pig, and notices that it has a wooden leg! The farmer
comes by and says ""Howdie"", and the passerby says ""I was just stopping to
admire your pig. What a lovely pig. But what's with the woo..."" The farmer
interrupts ""Oh, yes, this is the most wonderful pig! When our house had a
huge fire a few years back, and was burning down, this pig came in and
squealed and made sure we all woke up and got out. She really saved our
lives!"" ""My"", says the passerby, ""what a great story. But what's with the
wooden l..?"" The farmer jumps in again: ""And then, when my youngest was out
in the street playing just a few months ago, and a big tractor trailer came
barrelling down on her, this pig jumped right in and pushed her out of the
way, getting them both to the side of the road before the truck came by!""
""I'll say, that does show great bravery,"" said the passerby. ""But, if you
don't mind my asking, what *is* the deal with the wooden leg?"" The farmer
paused. ""Well,"" he said, ""a pig like that -- you don't want to eat it all at
once!""-- Sherry.

8424,"Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

3665,"esl in children cut off from their native language - any insights ? 2 years ago , my wife and i adopted two kids from russia , at the time aged 6 . 5 and 5 . at the time , i informally asked around and got the impression that there was unlikely to be anything particularly interesting linguistically about their experiences in learning english , and was referred to several books on esl / 2nd language learning among immigrants . unfortunately , due to the joys of parenting , i never read most of the references i was given ( i spent the time trying to learn russian instead ) . i recently read something in another adoptive parent 's posted experience that made me again wonder about my kids ' experiences in learning english , which so far have apparently been a little unusual for adoptive kids ( i ' ll skip the details at this point in my inquiry ) . i am starting to wonder if there is indeed something important in the language experiences of kids adopted into a foreign language environment after infancy . the key difference between international adoptions and other esl situations is that the older adopted kids suddenly are cut off from input in their native language with a certain level of vocabulary and mastery of that language , and thrown into an esl / 2nd language situation where they learn a new language usually with no support in their native language . learning the new language takes a considerable amount of time - my kids could communicate only minimally in english for about a year , but for most adoptive kids , use of the 1st language seems to stop within 1 - 3 months since the kids seem to realize that it no longer serves any useful communicative function . after 2 years , my kids speak what to most people sounds like fluent idiomatic english . however , their vocabulary seems greatly restricted compared to native english kids their age - and their passive vocabulary ( words they understand that they do n't use themselves ) seems to be especially restricted . they also have some peculiarities in grammar and usage - perhaps those typical of second language speakers , but ignored in the adoptive kids since they speak with no trace of an accent . these problems seem to be especially persistent , probably because they pass unnoticed most of the time ( they do show up in the kids ' writing now ) and they are resistent to correction . my readings in linguistics have thus far all seemed to generalize about a critical period lasting past my kids ' age , where they are supposed to learn languages like a sponge . the other adoptive parent , however , posted that in talking with esl experts , she found out that "" esl learners generally cannot do phonics in the second language , nor can they follow along in group oral reading . it takes 7 to 11 years in the second language to develop the ability to manipulate written english , particularly abstract cognitive academic material . "" that poster also said that children completely removed from their native language "" before mastering all of its principles "" have especial problems in learning the new language . she also said that many of the normal esl procedures break down in such kids , that there are no good tests for diagnosing language and learning problems in such kids , and that the situation is enough unlike the normal esl situation that trained esl teachers may not recognize problems or know how to solve them . she gave several references , but mostly on the pragmatic "" how to help your kid "" level . but putting on my linguist hat , and reading between the lines , i came up with some questions that i put to the linguistic community : 1 . is anyone reading this doing any research relating to language acquisition in kids cut off from their native tongue in the formative years ? 2 . can anyone provide me references to such work ? 3 . whether i get answers to # 1 or # 2 , what years are the "" formative years "" in which cutting off the child from the native language will have an effect on 2nd language learning ? 4 . does this age range have any relation to the "" critical period "" of language learning ? might there be a correlation that would tell us something about how and why kids learn languages differently and more easily than adults ? 5 . what are the different effects of cutting off a child from his native language at different ages / stages in language formation ? it seems pretty obvious that at the earliest years , "" 2nd language "" learning would asymptotically approach identity with the learning of the first language . 6 . when 1st and 2nd languages have contrasting features , it would seem that these kids would provide especial insight into ug models with parameters , in addition providing some clue as to when and how the parameters are set . has anyone looked at this ? 7 . what is the long-term language prognosis for such kids ? 7 to 11 years of language difficulty , when the difficulty often goes unnoticed ( or at least the fact that the difficulty is due to language problems - the adoptive parent who posted gave a detailed chronicle of her daughter 's varying problems from adoption at age 4 until 5th grade when the parent finally came to find out why her daughter was having problems even though she spoke english fluently ) - this seems likely to have severe long-term effects . 8 . my kids and all others i know of have completely lost the native language except for word isolates . do such kids relearn their native language any easier when they get older ? again , looking at contrasting features that such kids have difficulty relearning might tell us a lot about "" parameter setting "" especially when the difficulties do not match those of others acquiring the language as a 2nd langusge with no prior experience in the language . kids cut off from the native language would seem more likely to give clear data on this . 9 . are the effects of being cut-off from one 's native language different in kids like mine ? my kids were cut off from the native language only incompletely - they still had each other to talk to , in addition to my wife and my rudimentary self-teaching - but all of this continued exposure to the native language was impoverished both in vocabulary and grammar . ) russian remained the language of our household for most of the kids ' first year here , and i quickly came to understand the differences in language at differing ages . i could understand and communicate with my kids quite well ( and fluently ) in russian after about a month , but still cannot understand even a slow talking russian adult . the types of errors kids tolerate ( and make - my kids often had the ' wrong ' declensional ending on irregular words ) seem quite different from what adults accept . 10 . are there any english language discussions about child language acquisition in russian kids ? ( i ' m sure there are russian language sources , but i would never get through them . ) i would like to know what the typical russian child at the age my kids were adopted would typically have mastered in features like declensions , numbers , perfective / imperfective distinctions , and proper use of cases - things that i have n't mastered well enough to be able to extract from relistening to tapes thaty i made while they still spoke russian fluently . lojbab lojbab @ access . digex . net bob lechevalier , president , the logical language group , inc . 2904 beau lane , fairfax va 22031-1303 usa 703-385 - 0273 for the artificial language loglan / lojban , see ftp . cs . yale . edu / pub / lojban or see lojban www server : href = "" http : / / xiron . pc . helsinki . fi / lojban / """,0

Date: 2002-10-09T19:54:41-05:00Actually, 5.6. I clocked my â€œlong loopâ€ today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the â€œshort 
loopâ€ I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, â€œLook, another 
runner... not smiling!â€ This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.",0

A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
 Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
society.
C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
aren't 'found in the wild'.(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
of British conquest, but who doesn't?)(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)

http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
IrelandThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'>2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.

But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

Greedy CEOs are making a bad name for the profession--and corporate America. The title chief executive officer now

Read my full commentaryOracle challenges Microsoft anewOracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a Collaboration Suite that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure alternative to Exchange.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO Larry Ellison, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new licensing program may be more open to non-Micrososft alternatives.

PowerPC G4s, up to 2GB DDR SDRAM, two 64-bit 66MHz PCI slots (plus a third combination PCI/AGP slot), dual Gigabit Ethernet, 
FireWire and USB ports, and four Ultra ATA/100 Apple Drive Module bays. But Bill O'Brien thinks Apple's 
licensing may be even more appealing than the hardware.Read the full storyA notebook with desktop muscle
WinBook's big and heavy J4 uses a desktop Pentium 4 and leaves mobile P4-M notebooks in the dust. That means heavy

( 2 ) a change in the ecommerce landscape combined with auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property . enw has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since april with no outright bids . ( 3 ) however , the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons . according to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs . actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred , enron business units realized approximately $ 8 million in value . in the past , ena has done 13 data rooms , ees did 2 live auctions , ebs did 3 live auctions , corp . did 4 live auctions , tax did a deal room and nbpl did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non - enron clients . therefore , the question going forward is if several business units in enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002 . the total estimated expense for the application ( depreciation , ongoing technical and commercial support , etc . ) is $ 2 million for 2002 . if a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon , that would be great . the application works well and has provided real value to enron . if there is not enough interest in it , i will discuss with whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down . thanks . greg piper chief executive officer enron net works , llc _ _ _ _ _",0

a floppy.  otoh, every jumpstart config i've seen required rarp plus
plugging the new box's ethernet+ip into a file.  a kickstart boot can

with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -
""we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any
caution today"".--

What are you trying to sell???? What is the Value???Example...Does Pratchett sell paper bound by glue or does he sell stories?Question...When I buy a book have I purchased the story? When I sell the
book does any of that revenue go to mr Pratchett?What if I read the book and  give it to someone, who then reads it
and gives it  to someone who then reads it and gives it to
someones....(bookcrossing.com though with  more succesfull passings). Does
each reader send Mr Pratchett money?Have Used Bookstores, Recorstores etc destroyed the system of book/record

11234,"fw : rto week - - state commissioners fyi . tj and claudette - - please send to your groups . thanks - - - - - original message - - - - - from : landwehr , susan m . sent : thursday , october 18 , 2001 6 : 19 pm thursday morning session - - - - meeting with state commissioners this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process . although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend , upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame . it was a long morning ! i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts . approximately 35 to 40 % of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts . most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support . everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc , primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process , that ferc was moving too quickly , and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens . in particular , the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric . while many would think that the session was extremely negative ( our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting ! ) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing - - allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis . here ' s some individual comments : catherine riley / maryland - - - she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens ( she was way overboard in the dramatics department ) . she then stated that she was not at the meeting to "" help you ( ferc ) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record "" . it went on like this for about 15 minutes . the good part is that she was so personally negative , that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her . sam ervin / north carolina - - - he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens , that customer choice is never coming to his state , so he will never benefit from an rto , that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto ( and i bet if they do , he ' ll work to change the statutes ! ) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc . his comments were also pretty brutal , but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor . arnetta mcrae / delware - - - she kept on saying "" show me "" where the benefits for consumers are . she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order . rory mcminn / new mexico - - - repeatedly talked about how the west was different , how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers , how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were . carl wood / california - - tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole , and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments . he delivered the same messages that we ' ve been hearing forever - - - ferc should have acted sooner on price caps , etc etc . glen thomas / pennsylvania - - - he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it ' s energy system into the new century . . . that by opening it ' s markets they have had an explosion in green power , they have reduced costs all across the state , etc . he was very supportive of pjm ( makes sense because it ' s in his back yard ) and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance . judy jones / ohio - - - was very parochial in her discussion , but echoed don svanda ' s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed . ed garvey / minnesota - - - he got the gold star for the day . after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners , he took about 1 minute and said "" ferc - - just get it done "" . . . . in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward . other commissioners who talked were : arthur / connecticut , hadley / indiana , huelsman / kentucky , nugent / maine all on the positive side . other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do . from the ferc commissioner standpoint , the gold star went to massey . after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn ' t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough , he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back , saying the "" there has been 7 years of process , and he wants a process that comes to an end . . . . you ' ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree . . . "" call me if i can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting . sue . # 612 - 339 - 4599",0

perspective:  The few times I've encountered an obstacle installing
current Linux distributions on Dell boxes, it's been because Dell were
an early adopter of (e.g.) a new Adaptec SCSI chipset, which hadn't 
been included in all installation kernels.  And that is the risk you
_always_ take when you blindly buy hardware systems for Linux without
verifying chipset support, first.  If anything, Dell have over the years
occasioned less such trouble than have many competitors, in this area.--

we're currently in, and this has relevance to those switching jobs, or
those just entering the job market. Nano/bio startups are all screwed up,
alas. It's too early to wait for the radioactive glass to cool down while

15038,"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom

Date: Not suppliedDisney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em:     While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year.     ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""...     Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney6oct06,0,1287712.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dbusiness%2Dmanual

5162,"> Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. 
> Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Oh goodie. My final year project rears its head :-)> Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
> or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
> programming syntaxMuch as I would like to answer an unqualified ""yes"", I must admit: if 
you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the 
same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the 
same as when the manuals on ""modular coding"" said to write modules that 
would fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded 
to split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)However, ""Go-to considered harmful"" points out that to analyse (==debug) 
code, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and 
what the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) 
job if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if 
it uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF 
for the full letter).Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC 
at an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard 
offspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of 
hand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used 
GOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - 
you always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the 
benefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months 
time) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the 
hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.Dave

2865,"With enough warning, you might not even care about trying to divert 
the meteor -- you'd divert the Earth instead.I recall reading many years ago about calculations, done separately
both by US and USSR scientists for different reasons, about the
effect of nuclear explosions on the moon's mass, and thus its orbit,
and thus also (over time) the Earth's path around the sun.I believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon's 
composition would have the effect, over several years, of changing 
significantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point. Voila! No collision -- at least not with the initial threat. And
no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, either. Just

There seem to be several ""boneheads"" in our class. A few months ago I 
ran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic 
with him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, 
so I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he 
thought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there

   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan

seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?--

9468,"workshop announcement call for papers distributing and accessing linguistic resources workshop immediately before the first international conference on language resources and evaluation ( lrec ) , may 27 1998 granada , spain http : / / www . icp . grenet . fr / elra / conflre . html short description : this workshop will discuss ways to increase the efficacy of linguistic resource distribution and programmatic access , and work towards the definition of a new method for these tasks based on distributed processing and object-oriented modelling with deployment on the www . organizers : yorick wilks , hamish cunningham , wim peters , remi zajac workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in general the reuse of of nlp data resources ( such as lexicons or corpora ) has exceeded that of algorithmic resources ( such as lemmatisers or parsers ) . however , there are still two barriers to data resource reuse : 1 ) each resource has its own representation syntax and corresponding programmatic access mode ( e . g . sql for celex , c or prolog for wordnet , sgml for the bnc ) ; 2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st",0

5679,"lx as * science * ? i accept the editors ' recent challenge for resuming last year 's thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 's when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i ' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists ' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it 's * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n't there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where 's our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can't stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic ' attractors ' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein 's relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a "" pseudo-science "" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n't need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : "" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval 's most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be 's cientific ' - - then it had to be ' logical ' "" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , "" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? "" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a 's hamanic stance ' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as ' cause ' and 'd etermine ' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( "" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . "" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word ' karma ' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the ' comes around ' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning 'd irect object of verb ' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" > < - - john lennon >",0

Date: Not suppliedSince the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml

14163,""" syntax and the comparative method concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i ' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the 'd aughter ' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative ' mother ' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling 's book : man 's many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world 's population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous ' sprachbunds ' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n't even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are ' related ' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n't be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek ' colonies ' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain ' areal ' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can't really speak of the ' oddity ' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means ' odd ' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia ' langauges ' , would n't we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n't vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the ' parent ' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can ' prove ' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the ' unlikely ' correspondences ( i . e . ' ist / sind ' and ' est / sunt ' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany",0

( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal 2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal . 3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project . under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay . from an enron perspective : the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project . if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits . it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value . tod - - - - - original message - - - - - from : presto , kevin m . sent : saturday , september 15 , 2001 2 : 41 pm to : curry , mike ;

15354,"article on gas marketers : top gas gorillas note the discussion on market share halfway through the article . top gas gorillas show strong volume growth the year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing , with huge increases in gas prices , enormous volatility , continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits . physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in ngi ' s ranking grew 17 % to nearly 150 bcf / d , and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as williams reporting 2 , 000 % profit increases in their energy merchant segments . however , for many of the smaller players it was a tough year . "" the big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand , "" said ben schlesinger , president of maryland - based consulting firm schlesinger and associates , which tracks energy marketing . "" these people have price exposure on both sides of their business : the buy side and sell side . they ' ve actively sought to hedge these risks , but there ' s no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in 2000 . "" significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue , not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies , predicted schlesinger . "" for the first time i ' m not sure all 500 will make it because of the price volatility , and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers . "" if you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in california , you are going to suffer significantly . it ' s not much different at the henry hub either , he noted . the harsh reality is that only the strong will survive . ronald j . barone of ubs warburg believes the california energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers . "" i think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players , such as enron . customers want to go with somebody who is big , has facilities , somebody who is going to guarantee it , somebody who can do risk management for them . enron is the 800 - pound gorilla here . "" enron has been the 800 - pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of 750 - pound gorillas around . last year , however , enron found a way to trade natural gas over the internet and at last glance was well over 1 , 600 pounds , more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla , duke energy . enron sold 23 . 8 bcf / d of gas last year compared to only 13 . 3 bcf / d the year prior and compared to the 11 . 9 bcf / d sold by duke energy , which came in second place in ngi ' s ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume . enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool , enrononline , its web - based proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about 3 , 000 mainly natural gas transactions each day . in 2000 , enron completed its first full year of deploying enrononline , which quickly became the world ' s largest web - based e - commerce site . during the year , enron executed 548 , 000 transactions online with 3 , 000 customers , totaling $ 336 billion of gross value . the tremendous success of enrononline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry . when you look at enron ' s massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration . enron ' s 23 . 8 bcf / d is pretty large ( 35 % ) when compared with the 69 bcf / d that is actually consumed in north america . but you have to factor in multiple trades - - - one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on . according to schlesinger , the so - called "" churning factor "" is close to three . "" in the past several years when we ' ve been polling marketers , we got numbers ( in 1999 ) that came to about 60 tcf . we added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies . we did not have 100 % response in our survey - - - some of the mid - sized and smaller companies didn ' t respond . we reasonably extrapolated that about 65 tcf , maybe even 70 tcf of gas was traded each year in north america . physical consumption in north america is about 25 tcf so 70 divided by 25 is about 2 . 8 . "" using that calculation , enron with 23 . 8 bcf / d of physical gas sales in 2000 ends up with a not unreasonable 12 % market share . when the federal trade commission looks at markets and market share , it uses several tools , one of which is the herschman - herfindahl index , a measure of market concentration . it ' s the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant . if one company owns the entire 100 % of the market , that ' s an hhi of 10 , 000 . the department of justice has been using 1 , 800 as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions . according to schlesinger , the total gas industry has an hhi of only about 200 , way below any suggestion of market concentration . "" it ' s so low that it ' s unbelievable . it ' s a highly competitive business . even if one competitor has 12 % of the market ( hhi of 144 ) and the next competitor has 6 % and on down , it certainly doesn ' t send up any red flags , "" he said . "" it could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in 2000 , but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the united states . however , there may be some regional issues we have to think about , "" he added . "" we haven ' t looked at that , so i can ' t comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state , for example . "" there is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers . the leaders keep getting larger . volume growth averages at least 10 % per year or more . several factors should fuel future growth . price increases , volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers , according to both schlesinger and barone . online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place . schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the 17 % increase in volumes . enron attributed much of its growth to the online business . according to some observers , online trading still has plenty of room to grow . altra energy ceo paul bourke believes about 30 % of all gas trading now takes place over the internet . bourke said altra had 8 , 000 natural gas trades on its system in december . however barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the united states as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers . "" international should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line , "" he said . barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service , supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together . "" i think size , scope and scale are incredibly significant . "" only one of the top 20 major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors : axia , which grew out of the combination of koch energy and entergy . the rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers . thirteen out of the 20 top marketers showed double - or triple - digit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column . pg & e had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a 40 . 1 % decline in annual volumes and a 42 % decline in quarterly volumes . pg & e went through a significant reorganization last year . the move of its national energy group ( neg ) to bethesda , md , from houston , had the greatest impact on its trading activity . but the company also sold its energy services business and its texas gas transmission assets among other changes . "" it really slowed down our trading [ and ] a large number of people stayed behind in houston , "" said company spokesman patrick hurston . at the time of the move , the company estimated about half , or 100 , would make the move . hurston wouldn ' t say how many actually made the trip , but the company is still actively hiring . transcanada , which also underwent a massive reorganization last year , was the other company in the minus column with a 3 % decline in sales volume . the remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes : enron at 94 % , duke with 15 % growth , sempra with 51 % and bp amoco with 100 % growth .",0

xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.

which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to

, isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( "" john ran for half an hour "" ) , accomplishments ( "" john built a house "" ) and achievements ( "" john won the race "" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , "" start "" , "" begin "" , "" commence "" , "" initiate "" , "" resume "" ( for event beginnings ) , "" continue "" , "" keep "" ( for event middles ) and "" end "" , "" finish "" , "" terminate "" , "" halt "" , "" cease "" , "" complete "" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as "" start / finish "" , "" stop / resume "" , "" resume / finish "" , "" keep / end "" , "" continue / end "" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with "" end "" or "" finish "" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with "" have "" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as "" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation "" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .

   Version: 3.5

   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on

   Version: 1.3
   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSenMA07qVX4RVXFO5JSFR    Want to review Captain FTP? Submit your opinion here:

   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=88-ec5PQQKx6IOkSTY-rU358atSBbiR    Want to review AquilaCalendar? Submit your opinion here:

   you check out Tex-Edit Plus. This handy little editor offers
   all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,
   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client
   such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit. Text

   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 8.x/OS 9.x/OS X   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=07-HqCzI5rq9T_hx8KiqzUbrvLkiDeR    Want to review Boom? Submit your opinion here:

how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organized as a series of panels reporting on the outcome of discussions in the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the coling - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be included . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ?

I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ).

California messed up and the energy producers exploited.I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their

Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to CooperateJuly 23, 2002
By NATALIE ANGIER 
 What feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in
the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the
Securities and Exchange Commission? Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious
greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered
that the small, brave act of cooperating with another
person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over
selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy. Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a
classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in
which participants can select from a number of greedy or
cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain,
researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over
""me-ism,"" the mental circuitry normally associated with
reward-seeking behavior swelled to life. And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy,
the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of
pleasure. The researchers, performing their work at Emory University
in Atlanta, used magnetic resonance imaging to take what
might be called portraits of the brain on hugs. ""The results were really surprising to us,"" said Dr.
Gregory S. Berns, a psychiatrist and an author on the new
report, which appears in the current issue of the journal
Neuron. ""We went in expecting the opposite."" The researchers had thought that the biggest response would
occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other
defected, when the cooperator might feel that she was being
treated unjustly. Instead, the brightest signals arose in cooperative
alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already
known to respond to desserts, pictures of pretty faces,
money, cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights.
""It's reassuring,"" Dr. Berns said. ""In some ways, it says
that we're wired to cooperate with each other."" The study is among the first to use M.R.I. technology to
examine social interactions in real time, as opposed to
taking brain images while subjects stared at static
pictures or thought-prescribed thoughts. It is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient
conundrum, why are humans so, well, nice? Why are they
willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and
to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high
percentage of the time? Scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of
competitive behavior. But the depth and breadth of human
altruism, the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain
for the long-term common good, far exceeds behaviors seen
even in other large-brained highly social species like
chimpanzees and dolphins, and it has as such been difficult
to understand. ""I've pointed out to my students how impressive it is that
you can take a group of young men and women of prime
reproductive age, have them come into a classroom, sit down
and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other,"" said
Dr. Peter J. Richerson, a professor of environmental
science and policy at the University of California at Davis
and an influential theorist in the field of cultural
evolution. ""If you put 50 male and 50 female chimpanzees
that don't know each other into a lecture hall, it would be
a social explosion."" Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and colleagues
recently presented findings on the importance of punishment
in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the
willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or
violate norms, even when the chastisers take risks and gain
nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police. In her survey of the management of so-called commons in
small-scale communities where villagers have the right, for
example, to graze livestock on commonly held land, Dr.
Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University found that all
communities have some form of monitoring to gird against
cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource. In laboratory games that mimic small-scale commons, Dr.
Richerson said, 20 to 30 percent have to be coerced by a
threat of punishment to cooperate. Fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative
behavior to the degree observed among humans. If research
like Dr. Fehr's shows the stick side of the equation, the
newest findings present the neural carrot - people
cooperate because it feels good to do it. In the new findings, the researchers studied 36 women from
20 to 60 years old, many of them students at Emory and
inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards.
The scientists chose an all-female sample because so few
brain-imaging studies have looked at only women. Most have
been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women. But there is a vast body of non- imaging data that rely on
using the Prisoner's Dilemma. ""It's a simple and elegant model for reciprocity,"" said Dr.
James K. Rilling, an author on the Neuron paper who is at
Princeton. ""It's been referred to as the E. coli of social
psychology."" >>From past results, the researchers said, one can assume
that neuro- imaging studies of men playing the game would
be similar to their new findings with women. The basic structure of the trial had two women meet each
other briefly ahead of time. One was placed in the scanner
while the other remained outside the scanning room. The two
interacted by computer, playing about 20 rounds of the
game. In every round, each player pressed a button to
indicate whether she would ""cooperate"" or ""defect."" Her
answer would be shown on-screen to the other player. The monetary awards were apportioned after each round. If
one player defected and the other cooperated, the defector
earned $3 and the cooperator nothing. If both chose to
cooperate, each earned $2. If both opted to defect, each
earned $1. Hence, mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far
more profitable strategy, at $40 a woman, than complete
mutual defection, which gave each $20. The risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for
a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would
fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer. In some cases, both women were allowed to pursue any
strategy that they chose. In other cases, the non- scanned
woman would be a ""confederate"" with the researchers,
instructed, unbeknown to the scanned subject, to defect
after three consecutive rounds of cooperation, the better
to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike
and gritty. In still other experiments, the woman in the scanner played
a computer and knew that her partner was a machine. In
other tests, women played a computer but thought that it
was a human. The researchers found that as a rule the freely
strategizing women cooperated. Even occasional episodes of
defection, whether from free strategizers or confederates,
were not necessarily fatal to an alliance. ""The social bond could be reattained easily if the defector
chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds,"" another
author of the report, Dr. Clinton D. Kilts, said, ""although
the one who had originally been `betrayed' might be wary
from then on."" As a result of the episodic defections, the average
per-experiment take for the participants was in the $30's.
""Some pairs, though, got locked into mutual defection,"" Dr.
Rilling said. Analyzing the scans, the researchers found that in rounds
of cooperation, two broad areas of the brain were
activated, both rich in neurons able to respond to
dopamine, the brain chemical famed for its role in
addictive behaviors. One is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the
brain right above the spinal cord. Experiments with rats
have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum,
the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the
electrodes, apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback
that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing
the bar. Another region activated during cooperation was the
orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes. In
addition to being part of the reward-processing system, Dr.
Rilling said, it is also involved in impulse control. ""Every round, you're confronted with the possibility of
getting an extra dollar by defecting,"" he said. ""The choice
to cooperate requires impulse control."" Significantly, the reward circuitry of the women was
considerably less responsive when they knew that they were
playing against a computer. The thought of a human bond,
but not mere monetary gain, was the source of contentment
on display. In concert with the imaging results, the women, when asked
afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games,
often described feeling good when they cooperated and
expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their
playing partners. Assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent
innate among humans and reinforced by the brain's feel-good
circuitry, the question of why it arose remains unclear.
Anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for
humanity's ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult
plant foods or rear difficult children. So the capacity to
cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears. Yet as with any other trait, the willingness to abide by
the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and
steal from one's neighbors is not uniformly distributed. ""If we put some C.E.O.'s in here, I'd like to see how they
respond,"" Dr. Kilts said. ""Maybe they wouldn't find a
positive social interaction rewarding at all."" A Prisoner's Dilemma indeed.

                               time for a snooze         There comes a time in every August when news services should
         just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
         underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
         the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
         it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
         barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
         bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
         free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
         getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
         they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
         look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
         window until dawn.         Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
         server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.         Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
         the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the ""Hyperactive""
         chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
         you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
         seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
         Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
         about ""using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
         effects"", ""techniques for making little speakers sound huge""
         and - perhaps most distressingly - ""picking the right
         instrument and register for best audibility"". The
         cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
         and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lovers worldwide.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering         Dijkstra finally gone? Great. Now we can hang out with those
         sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the
         house. Right on cue: the latest dev version of GNU
         SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
         2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
         implying you might actually be able to do something useful
         with it. Admittedly, ""useful"" has not been a word  much used
         in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current
         addicts seem to live entirely in the pleasuredomes of that
         Land of Infinite Fun, Alan Kay's Smalltalk sequel SQUEAK,
         the cross-platform UI-kablooie playground which, over time,
         been overloaded with more ill-fitting metaphors than this
         sentence. But even Squeak is showing signs of returning to
         planet Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's
         peculiarly homely interface right now). There's even word of
         a SmallTalkish scripting language in the offing. And all
         those new MacOS X Objective C hackers are following the
         trail back to the NeXT's great ancestor, giving a timely
         boost to the tribe. Xerox Parc *will* return!

         think he was looking at ""some really bloated computer

         easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
         report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
         biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's

         solid"" and ""might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
         chocolate flavour they impart"". While, following last week's
         announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
         reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
         of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a ""Fear

         whole point of that controversial ""It's not for girls""

[can't think of how I'd be running
afoul of the spam filters with this
post, so here's the second try...]Kissinger's book _Does America Need
a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
handy abstractions:> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
> values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
> between peace and justice.Also, he views historical American
approaches to foreign policy as a
bundle of three fibers:Hamiltonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to preserve balances of power.Wilsonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to further democracy, etc.Jacksonian - We should never get
  involved in foreign adventures.
  Unless we're attacked.  Then we
  go Rambo.He has tactfully left out the hard
realists*; as for the rest I gather
wilsonians play the idealists, and
hamiltonians act where values and
interests intersect, and jacksonians 
act only when values and interests
overlap.Kissinger himself seems to be a
Hamiltonian; much of the book is
about how he thinks we ought to
be shaping the balance of power
in various foreign regions.Maybe I've been too affected by
Kant, but I can't see that such
a strategy works unless one can
count on a Bismarck runnning it:
how lopsided does the US look if
everyone tries to run a balance
of power politics?- -Dave*
> The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims
> of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.  No empire has avoided the
> road to Caesarism unless, like the British Empire, it devolved its
> power before this process could develop.  In long-lasting empires,
> every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled

> internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.
> A deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the
> values that made the United States great.Kings and tyrants generically have
followed the same power politics:
garner popular support by keeping
potential oligarchs down.  In other
traditions, a king is a legitimate
tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
such fine distinctions.

17723,"Craig, For the most part, 99% times 99% users agree on what is spam. This is the
nature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a ""personal trust""
system, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of
the userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,
only after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would
be stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to
bootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.As regards to the problems with the ""gray"" areas you mentioned, servers
recognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make
individual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence
level they are confortable with.cheers,

>   and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )I can speak for some Chinese input methods and you can do a hell
of a lot better than a few chars per minute.  For example, the
simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out
each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example,
Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong',
then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the
most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for
the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3.You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that
much different to English.  However, until you get familiar
with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can
be a little slow.Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the
phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost
always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is
'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to
the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent
'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd
enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible
matches.I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where
you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only
use that when you know the character you want but you don't
know how to pronounce it.>

Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC.Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me
on Red Hat 7.2o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The
   fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable
   Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMso  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging
   in.Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in
your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the
menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your
way around.Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When 
in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't
understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use
Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space.Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and 
you'll see the Chinese for China.Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left
as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput
and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.Later,

Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-281-500-4018.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.+++++

Date: Not suppliedBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that 
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*A discussion draft  
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
 and Industry Canada 
, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
, which the country is in the 
process of considering.If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
, 
or ratified, the treaty.Michael Geist , a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
 (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.A representative for George Radwanski 
, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
 no later than Nov. 15.

By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

9684,"Hiya folks,I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.This is a bit of a bummer.Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.Dave._______________________________________________

INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
EVENT
Â Exhibitions India
organises the Convergence 
India Â exhibition & conference, which is the
longest running 
international trade-show and the only forum in India

New Delhi, 
India duringÂ 11-13 March
2003.
Â 
The 
Government of India has recently mandated the Conditional
Access System for 
distribution of satellite television channels. This has
created a whole new 
marketplace in the Indian cable industry. Once this bill is
made an act, it will 
be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels
through a set-top 
box.India has an estimated 38
million cable homes! The 
implementation of this change will require massive
investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great 
oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your
products at the 
11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an
opportunity to meet 
all yourÂ  targetted visitors under a
single 
roof.Other
exhibits will be from 
various industries including high speed networking, internet
telephony, mobile 
and satellite communications, network infrastructure, optical
access networking, 
portable communication devices, t&m and interactive
media, VoIP, wireless 
access, 3G, m-commerce, multimedia broadband services via
satellite, conditional 
access technologies, satellite receivers and transmitters,
encoders, decoders, 
and the latest in broadcast, cable and satellite
equipment,Â mobile phone 
accesoriesÂ  etc.We 
successfully concluded the 10th Convergence
India 2002 
exhibition and conference at New Delhi - the event
hadÂ 176 exhibitors from 
17Â countries displaying their equipment and technologies
to a discerning 
audience ofÂ 16,093 visitors from the industry,
government, related trade 
associations. The event got extensive coverage from
theÂ media - both print 
and electronic. The three day high profile conference had
over 1374 delegates. 
Highlights of the event wereÂ country pavilions from
USA, 
FRANCE, CHINA & the
VoIP 
Technology Pavilion.

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLYSimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most

the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to ""let-it-burn"".The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.--

"" the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on "" essentially the same terms "" as they have in the past . "" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , "" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances . the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said . bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . "" confidence in this company was lost , "" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . "" but confidence will be restored . "" corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . manager ' s journal : how enron ran out of gas by paul kedrosky 10 / 29 / 2001 the wall street journal a 22 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) is troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern . a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled . not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers . the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy . but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a "" new economy "" web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then . then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight . it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad . not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter . enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march 2000 10 - k , a "" senior officer of enron is the managing member "" of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron "" manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . "" it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund . there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done . as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers . to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 . we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency . where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves . - - - mr . kedrosky is a professor of business at the university of british colombia . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a enron seeks additional financing by richard a . oppel jr . 10 / 29 / 2001 the new york times page 9 , column 4 c . 2001 new york times company dallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today . last week , enron , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it . enron ' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company ' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . ' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said . two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting . enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating . copyright ? 2000 dow jones oct 29 , 2001 by agencies : agency material and elizabeth wine enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue . more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar . mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders . janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn . the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january . most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are "" dated "" , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed . morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been "" lightening up "" their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when . ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been "" trimmed substantially "" . other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund . copyright : the financial times limited comment & analysis - enron flickers . by simon london and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 29 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty . enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind . its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these "" related - party transactions "" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed . with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity . "" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , "" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank . on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "" new economy "" magic on to old economy companies . enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading . for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it . the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets . the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : "" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . "" the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a "" loose - tight "" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets . up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years . balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : "" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . "" this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company . it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider . in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing . in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation . a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . "" they went after too many things too quickly , "" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency . a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed . david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : "" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . "" the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . "" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , "" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . "" enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise . "" they over - promised on the new business they created , "" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . "" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . "" will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets . and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

"" it ' s a different place , "" aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company . "" the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , "" said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman . return to traditional values bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business . it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise . "" calpine does it already , "" he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . "" what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , "" he added . howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies . smaller companies also rethink strategies as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line . "" earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . "" said patterson . michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america . cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments . allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings . the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time . "" the company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders , "" allegheny said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones reportedly for 1 - 2 bln usd 10 / 29 / 2001 afx ( ap ) copyright 2001 afx news ; source : world reporter ( tm ) new york ( afx ) - enron corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line , a spokesman told the wall street journal . the company is in talks to raise between 1 - 2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days , it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying . the deal , which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence , would supplement existing lines . these are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears . enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer , andrew fastow . jms for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . markets enron said seeking new credit lines by laura mandaro and alissa schmelkin 10 / 29 / 2001 american banker 31 copyright ( c ) 2001 thomson financial , inc . all rights reserved . the texas energy and telecommunications giant enron corp . was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines friday , a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines . j . p . morgan chase bank one corp . about $ 100 million ; and wachovia corp . , suntrust banks inc . , and fleetboston financial corp . about $ 50 million each , according to goldman sachs estimates . bank of new york has between $ 50 to $ 100 million of exposure , and northern trust , u . s . bancorp and keycorp also have some lending exposure , ms . applebaum said . representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with enron , or did not return phone calls by deadline . http : / / www . americanbanker . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron in talks for $ 1 - 2 bln credit line - wsj . 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy trading giant enron corp . is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion and could close a deal within days , the wall street journal reported in its online edition on monday . according to officials close to the situation , the new credit would supplement existing credit lines , largely tapped out after the company drew down about $ 3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors ' fears , the journal reported . the paper said that an enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but could not supply any further details . confidence in enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships . its stock has tumbled amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into the company ' s ousted chief financial officer ' s links to some of the partnerships . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . japan : japan ' s teijin , enron study coal - fired power plant . 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . tokyo , oct 29 ( reuters ) - japan ' s major polyester manufacturer , teijin ltd , said on monday it would conduct a feasibility study with u . s . energy giant enron corp on building a coal - fired power plant . teijin said in a statement that it and e power corp , a japanese affiliate of enron corp , would look into building the 70 , 000 kilowatt coal - burning thermal power plant in matsuyama , ehime prefecture , on the southwestern island of shikoku , where teijin has a polyester plant . "" we are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants , with eyes on further deregulation in japan ' s power market , "" a teijin spokesman said . japan is in the process of deregulating its power market . since march last year , large - lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers . in its polyester business , teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production , a trend which would leave it with surplus power . it is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus . the two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of teijin ' s existing power generator in matsuyama , teijin said . it hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of enron . enron corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in japan . the teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by june 2002 . teijin ' s shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2 . 68 percent at 472 yen . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 once - mighty enron strains under scrutiny by alex berenson and richard a . oppel jr . 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company is time running out for enron ? at the beginning of this year , the enron corporation , the world ' s dominant energy trader , appeared unstoppable . the company ' s decade - long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from california to new york . its ties to the bush administration assured that its views would be heard in washington . its sales , profits and stock were soaring . and under the leadership of jeffrey k . skilling , its chief executive , enron ' s arrogance had grown even more quickly . the company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets . ' ' we are on the side of angels , ' ' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california ' s energy crisis . ' ' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it ' s the american way . ' ' but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting . some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value . enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day . the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company . the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached . enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas . the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch . the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash . enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide . the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year . philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations . ' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' ' in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company . a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits . enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades . ' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo . for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 . ' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said . still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation . mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business . but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements . now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask . to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances . the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference . deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships . enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose . in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors . mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company . in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' ' mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year . in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming . david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call . to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume . ' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' ' but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years . now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy . ' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' ' ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said . short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say . ' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' ' james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits . even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy . ' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist . in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission . enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices . large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states . before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power . beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business . the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' ' for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement . enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that . enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not . enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound . but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight . photos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings . q . is that legal under the accounting rules ? a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 databank investors seem to ignore discouraging news by michael brick 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 17 , column 3 c . 2001 new york times company investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor . the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 . investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent . all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates . the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 . michael brick charts : ' ' stocks in the news ' ' enron nyse : ene the energy trading company ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron caught the attention of the s . e . c . friday ' s close : $ 15 . 40 week ' s change : - 40 . 88 % est .

"" nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week . palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "" good management decisions . "" on oct . 16 enron ' s third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest . the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron . fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise . the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence . reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan . "" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin told the houston chronicle for saturday ' s editions . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing .

' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday after it tapped into more than $ 3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re - assure investors and customers . shares fell 95 cents on friday to $ 15 . 40 , a level not seen since 1995 , as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company ' s earnings announcement earlier this month . the stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks , and the company lost almost $ 14 billion in market value . late this week the company decided to convert $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash . the company put about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $ 2 . 2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short - term corporate iou known as commercial paper . "" nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week . palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "" good management decisions . "" enron ' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest . the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company ' s newer businesses such as broadband trading . fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise . the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence . now enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms . "" to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , "" said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan . but reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , he said . "" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin said . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing . "" just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , "" she said . "" do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . "" jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned . in a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron ' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it . "" thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , "" dietert wrote in a report friday . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . "" feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store . for example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets . chewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron ' s global equity markets group . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron says microsoft breached contract staff 10 / 27 / 2001 houston chronicle 3 star 2 ( copyright 2001 ) enron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service . the companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron ' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas . qwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn . on oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn ' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project ' s first phase . the lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest . enron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was "" confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron .

' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees . to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge . mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today . the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern . pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist . it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag . as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' ' ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) . if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion . the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment . since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . ' ' maybe we ' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can ' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it ' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff . drawing copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . city - enron directors cash in shares . by simon english . 10 / 27 / 2001 the daily telegraph p 31 ( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001 leading executives at enron , the troubled us energy giant , cashed in shares worth more than $ 100 m ( # 70 m ) this year in the run - up to a financial crunch that has left the company ' s credibility in ruins . research by thomson financial shows that kenneth lay , chief executive , sold about 400 , 000 shares this year , netting him more than $ 25 m . he still held 2 . 8 m shares until july . other executives made similar sales , a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $ 83 at the start of the year to $ 45 by july . they halved again this week and fell to below $ 16 yesterday . enron declined to comment on the share sales . mr lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "" dispel uncertainty in the financial community "" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in enron ' s financial strength . enron will pay off debts of $ 2 . 2 billion and keep another $ 800 , 000 in cash . he said : "" we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community .

3448,"  The way Razor breaks down mail is simple.  If a mail contains MIME
  boundaries it is split on those boundaries, each MIME part is considered 
  when marking the mail as spam.
  
  In 2.14, there are different 'logic methods' for detecting spam.
  The default method 5 requires all non-contention parts to be spam for
  the mail to be marked as spam.  A part is considered under
  contention if its not clear if its spam are not, and is relatively
  rare.  Sounds like you are not using 2.14, or maybe you're misinterpreting
  the log files.  Feel free to send me the log files if you think 
  there is a bug.  Also, as jordan says, if you get a legit mail marked as spam (based
  on whatever MIME stuff is going on), you should revoke it (which sends
  all parts in) so TeS can take care of business.    cheers,

You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential

13264,"special request from : mr . cheung pui hang seng bank ltd sai wan ho branch 171 shaukiwan road hong kong . let me start by introducing myself . i am mr . cheung pui director of operations of the hang seng bank ltd , sai wan - ho branch . i have an obscured business suggestion for you . one of our clients / personal friend , late mr . morris thompson an american who was a private business man unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed on january 31 st 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you can read more about the crash on visiting these site below , before the plane crash , mr . morris thompson made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of us $ 24 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty four million , five hundred thousand united state dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him , another notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later found out that mr . morris thompson and his family had been killed in that plane crash . after further investigation it was also discovered that mr . morris thompson ? s next of kin is his daughter who died with him . what bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to mr . morris thompson so that you will be able to receive these funds for both of us . what is to be done : want you to know that i have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successfully . i have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to mr . morris thompson , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided by you . this process is 100 % risk free as we have set out all the modalities to see that a legalized method is used because the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents . please note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times during this transaction . once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70 % for me , 25 % for you and 5 % set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this transaction . if you are not interested , please delete this letter so that i can scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction . should you be interested please send me your full names , telephone / fax number , and email address . i will prefer that you reach me via this email address ( cheungpui 9000 @ netscape . net ) your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated . kind regards , mr . cheung pui . tel / fax : 852 - 301 - 61206",1

entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogense comme hermneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interprtation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle traiter le signe ? * quel est le rle des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interprtation ? pourquoi les viter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interprtation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interprtation collective et du rle de la multiplicit des points de vue , qu ' ils soient mthodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en rsulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interprtation comme rsolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' volution ? * si , comme dans la deuxime dfinition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours dj signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ? qu ' est-ce qui les rend signifiants ? qu ' en est-il de la pense symbolique des civilisations anciennes ou orientales et qui a t cultive chez nous jusqu ' au moyen - age ( g . durand ) ? comment cette forme d ' interprtation s ' articule-t - elle avec les signes dcontextualiss , jusqu ' tre calculables et la conception de l ' interprtation qui en dcoule ? * de quels processus de lgitimation des interprtations disposons-nous ? quelles relations l ' interprtation entretient-elle avec l ' action ou l ' argumentation que ce soit avant , par ou aprs coup ?

Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2002 00:18:04 GMT""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.[1] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4032

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)Thomas-

10540,"The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I 
think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status 
for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans 
yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the 
AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which 
will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, 
like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that 
they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts 
of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, 
etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs 
all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small 
salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support 
from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for 
money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get 
into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will 
have to wait.  But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.

feeling
by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"".And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that.""http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'. Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff awayFriday September 8, 2000 ... On the way down from the roof, through the ""workers' quarters"" which Van Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the subject of peasants, expanding on the ""worthless"" and ""lazy"" majority who make up the council estates of this country. ""You are playing up to your villainous image,"" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed. ""I'm not villainous,"" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard and hard labour is what distinguishes the ""riff-raff"" from the ""elite"". I ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, ""old-moneyed bastards"" whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as ""those rat bags drawing social security.""... He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the public mourning, remembers being pleased. ""I was glad,"" he says. ""He was only in it for the ego trip."" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. ""She made us look like fools,"" he says. ""She made a mockery of the royal family."" Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says gloopily, ""they are all we've got, so we have to respect them."" He says he favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible because ""the power has gone to their heads."" (Mugabe himself is the most modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming). Margaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made him feel ""proud to be English"". ...The 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a genuine dickhead.

I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

In a message dated 9/19/2002 7:46:37 AM, chuck@topsail.org writes:>That means *you* can't say anything may not be FoRKed or printed or 
>whatever. You have the choice to ignore it
That's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot 
say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, 
The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is ""fit to print."" If 
the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would 
be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it 
chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary 
corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to 
refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a 
state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other 
specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the 
""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does 
as a matter of custom.For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an 
expression of their political beliefs.Tom

the bank software that come with a solid database to help you manage your clientele and your fees , and the check writing module that allows you to download check files from the bank and print reatime refunds checks to your clients ;

the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . iqrf gisvhq jyip m wcgjlusxi m j ngyl jlri oiyg",1

11124,"california update # 2 , 2 / 23 / 01 1 . bankruptcy an increasingly attractive option for davis despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms , back at the poker table in sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy . indeed , almost any reading of governor gray davis ' s political situation after the shock la federal court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet . at least one of the three major power generators ( pg & e ) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now , particularly after yesterday ' s ferc ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy . 2 . davis wants to keep hope alive until analyst meetings next week today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the national governor ' s association and meet with wall street analysts tuesday and wednesday . in fact , davis ' s desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in california . according to talks with all sides , davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers ( pg & e , socal edison and san diego ) for something like $ 7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells . but the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court - ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary , but politically difficult . according to key sacramento officials , "" confidence continues to wane in davis ' ability to do this . the plain fact is the stick he ' s carrying isn ' t awfully big . "" adds another : "" the key people here just think the utilities are playing him . either they ' re playing him , or he ' s going to roll on the price , he ' s going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth . the utilities got away with the same kind of thing before , in 1996 of course . "" davis is more astute than that , and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in los angeles . 3 . little support for transmission assets deal the transmission assets deal doesn ' t look attractive for anyone . davis has no particular affinity for it , having adopted state senator burton ' s proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade . the legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry , and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network . the utilities - - pg state offers only tepid support for bond scheme "" there are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn ' t pick up "" says one california official . "" the way they calculate depreciation is very strange . if the accounts were done on a proper gaap basis instead of some kind of ferc basis they would look different . "" even if the deal goes through , the financing could be difficult and very expensive . the state has definitively ruled out putting the full faith and credit of the state of california behind the proposed bonds . state treasurer angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they ' d qualify for tax - exempt status . 5 . small ipp players furious and while the big players talk , there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators . the small companies have been the biggest losers so far - - their representative , jan smutny - jones , was tossed off the board of the california iso , and the closing of the california px deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power . the ceos of large companies like dynegy and reliant are talking to davis on a daily basis , but the small companies are out of the loop . they also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long . large companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential political and relationship risks across the us if they get cast in the role of villain in california . for the small companies , however , it is a matter of survival . some legislators in sacramento are operating under the assumption that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to force bankruptcy . not so . all it takes is three creditors owed at least $ 11 , 000 each to apply for bankruptcy . two small companies , cal energy and ridgewood power , are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment . if bankruptcy is triggered , there is immense uncertainty about what would happen . no major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome , especially after the shock of judge lew ' s unexpected ruling in los angeles . it is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the state supreme court . ferc and the federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly . but to many of the players , that uncertain mess following bankruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal .",0

> ....and with the crucial hair feature enabled!That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
improves my day immeasurably.I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.Eirikur

10758,"Hi Thor,[Still trying to catch my breath] :-)I guess there's no easy way to avoid this. In order to proactively
protect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into
their defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and
heuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running
into false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these
some are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.
Consider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft
software without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to
protect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.
malicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason. Looking

( nyt 11 - 29 c 7 ) for the web site of the new york times , see { nyti } . enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 10 ( new york ) enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( updatel ) ( updates sixth paragraph with details on cash crunch ; adds details of how credit ratings were cut . ) new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . plunged from the largest energy trader to the verge of bankruptcy under a board of directors whose independence was undercut by financial ties to management , according to corporate governance experts . enron gave seven of its 14 directors consulting contracts , sales to their business or donations to their non - profit institutions , according to company and public records . the recipients include three members of enron ' s audit committee , which is responsible for financial oversight . lord john wakeham , for example , a former leader of the british house of commons , sits on the audit committee . enron gave him a $ 72 , 000 - a - year consulting contract . john mendelsohn , president of the md anderson cancer center in houston , is also on the audit committee . in the last five years enron and its chairman kenneth lay have donated $ 567 , 900 to the cancer center . ` ` to get on a board you have to be ` clubbable , ' but this looks like collegiality turning to cronyism , ' ' said allan cleveland , counsel to the new hampshire retirement system , an enron shareholder . enron , based in houston , texas handled almost a quarter of all natural gas and electricity trades . during the past seven weeks , its board has presided over a $ 26 billion drop in market value that began after the company wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity and reported it had overstated earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 . as enron ' s shares fell , the company suffered a cash crunch . it sought an infusion of capital and agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , a houston - based rival . that plan collapsed yesterday as investors balked at investing $ 1 . 5 billion , prompting dynegy to withdraw its offer . enron shares closed at 61 cents . responsibility corporate boards are responsible for protecting shareholder interests by reviewing the work of top executives . to accomplish that , two - thirds of a board should be ` ` independent ' ' from management , according to the council of institutional investors , which represents pension funds . the council defines an independent director as ` ` a person whose directorship constitutes his or her only connection to the corporation . ' ' ` ` consulting contracts , donations to non - profit organizations linked to directors , this eats away at independence , ' ' said ann yergen , the council ' s director of research . corporate governance standards established by the new york and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should be independent . enron board members , including wakeham and mendelsohn , declined repeated requests for interviews . vance meyer , a company spokesman , said enron could not immediately respond to questions regarding the board . compensation enron ' s board met nine times in 2000 with each member receiving annual compensation of $ 79 , 000 in cash and stock . every member attended at least 75 percent of the meetings , except ronnie chan , chief executive of the hang lung group , a hong kong development business , according to company filings . based on enron proxy statements and other documents , the following relationships existed between enron and board members : - - herbert s . winokur jr . , 57 , is the managing partner of capricorn investors l . p . , a holding company that owns the natco group inc . , a maker of oil and gas production equipment . an enron board member since 1985 , winokur serves on the executive committee , chairs the finance committee and was appointed to a special committee created to look into how enron was managed . in 2000 , natco had $ 370 , 294 in sales to enron subsidiaries , or about 1 . 6 percent of natco ' s total sales . ` compromising ' ` ` we think that anything over 1 percent is compromising , ' ' said yergen of the council of institutional investors . enron said in a proxy statement it believes the terms of the sales were ` ` no less favorable than the terms of similar arrangements with third parties . ' ' - - robert a . belfer , 65 , has been on the board since 1983 and sits on the executive committee . he is enron ' s largest individual shareholder with 8 . 5 million shares , and is chairman and chief executive of belco oil & gas corp . , which operates from an office overlooking new york ' s central park . in 2000 , belco had $ 32 million in trade settlements and $ 1 million in option premiums with enron trade resources corp . , an enron subsidiary . - - john urquhart , 72 , a former general electric co . executive , sat on the board until last may . he received an annual consulting fee from enron of almost $ 200 , 000 a year as a special adviser to the enron chairman . - - mendelsohn , 64 , is a physician who was formerly head of medicine at memorial sloan - kettering cancer center in new york . he pioneered research in controlling cancer through the chemistry of a tumor ' s growth and was on president george w . bush ' s short list to head the national institutes of health . since 1996 , mendelsohn has been president of the md anderson cancer center , part of the university of texas health system . donations mendelsohn joined enron ' s board in 1999 . enron has donated $ 221 , 650 to the cancer center . lay and a foundation he established with his wife , the linda and ken lay family foundation , have donated $ 346 , 250 in the last five years . the enron foundation pledged $ 1 . 5 million for a new clinic . - - charles lemaistre , 77 , headed the andersen cancer center for 18 years until retiring in 1996 . he has been an enron board member for 16 years , is a member of the executive committee and chairs the compensation committee . that panel awarded lay a $ 20 million - a - year severance package that he renounced two weeks ago . - - wendy gramm , 56 , has held positions at the federal trade commission and the u . s . office of management and budget and was chairman of the u . s . commodity futures trading commission . she is director of regulatory studies at the mercatus center of george mason university in fairfax , virginia . she is married to texas republican senator phil gramm . in the last three years , enron and the ken and linda lay family foundation have donated more than $ 50 , 000 to the university and the mercatus center , according to university records . consulting fee - - wakeham , 68 , a charted accountant and self - made millionaire , became a force in the government of former u . k . prime minister margaret thatcher where he was known as her ` ` mr . fix - it . ' ' he was the target of an irish republican army bomb in 1984 that killed his wife and left him buried under rubble for seven hours . enron pays wakeham $ 6 , 000 a month to advise the company on european business . enron ' s audit committee poses particular problems , according to corporate governance experts . the committee is composed of wakeham , mendelsohn , gramm , chan , robert jaedicke , a retired stanford university business school dean , and paulo ferraz pereira , a brazilian banker . wakeham , gramm and mendelsohn are not independent , according to corporate governance experts and standards . ` ` for the audit committee , you don ' t even want the appearance of a conflict , ' ' said charles drott , a forensic accountant who has testified as an expert witness in bankruptcy and business fraud cases involving companies such as delorean motor co . and lincoln savings and loan association . the committee is spread across the globe , with wakeham in london , ferraz in rio de janeiro and chan in hong kong . ` ` the question is why this committee ? ' ' drott asked . ` ` for a big sophisticated company like enron , why did they choose these people ? ' ' swift descent enron ' s rapid decline - - standard & poor ' s corp . slashed its credit rating eight levels this month to junk status - - centered on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial reports obscured the partnerships ' businesses to the point they were impossible to understand . enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron , the company disclosed . enron documents filed with the u . s . securities and exchange commission state that the board determined that fastow ' s participation in the partnerships would ` ` not adversely affect the interests of enron . ' ' the documents also say the board approved all transactions involving partnerships that were brought to it by lay and other enron executives . ` ` what went wrong at enron ? ' ' said patrick mcgurn , a vice president at institutional investor services , which evaluates board candidates for institutional investors . ` ` a lot of it goes back to the board . ' ' enron ' s indian lenders may take over power project ( update 2 ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 32 ( new york ) enron ' s indian lenders may take over power project ( update 2 ) ( adds comment from idbi managing director in ninth paragraph , legal details starting in seventh paragraph . ) mumbai , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s indian lenders may take over its $ 3 billion power venture to salvage loans of $ 2 billion if the energy trader files for bankruptcy in the u . s . enron may be forced into the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history after dynegy inc . walked away from a rescue . rating agencies cut most of enron ' s $ 15 billion of debt to junk status , and its shares are almost worthless . india ' s dabhol power co . , one of enron ' s biggest asian gas and power units , has been mired in accusations of bribery and exorbitant power tariffs . ` ` lenders will have to take control of the project , ' ' said madhav godbole , who headed a panel set up to resolve a payment dispute between dabhol power , enron ' s india unit , and the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . ` ` buyers ( for dabhol ) will have to negotiate with the lenders . ' ' enron , which is owed $ 64 million for bills that are more than 10 months overdue , wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in dabhol as it exits india . tata power ltd . and bses ltd . , the two bidders for enron ' s stake , have said the price is too high . both supply power to mumbai , india ' s commercial capital . the industrial development bank of india , the country ' s biggest lender , and the state bank of india are among local lenders that loaned $ 1 . 4 billion to dabhol . they have the most at stake if the loans turn bad . the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . and other overseas banks is covered by government guarantees , while indian bank loans are not . cancellation notice enron on may 19 issued a six - month notice canceling power sales to the electricity board . the deadline lapsed on nov . 19 as the mumbai high court early this month stopped dabhol from serving the final termination notice until dec . 3 . the court ' s move was in response to a suit filed by indian lenders against dabhol to prevent it from canceling the contract . they were concerned the loss - making electricity board will be forced to buy the power plant , making loan recovery difficult . ` ` the matter has become extremely interesting ( for india ) in the context of dynegy pulling out , ' ' idbi chairman p . p . vora told reporters at the lenders ' earnings meet . ` ` i can ' t say more as the matter is in the court . ' ' idbi alone has lent dabhol $ 400 million . indian lenders won ' t attend a dabhol board meeting or a summit of creditors , both of which are to be held in london tomorrow , vora said , without giving any reason . dabhol ' s board is meeting to authorize k . wade cline , managing director , to serve the termination notice . discount ? enron ' s stake in dabhol may now be worth much less than the $ 1 billion it is seeking . still , potential buyers may find it hard to raise the money they will need to finish work on the plant . construction contractors in june stopped work on expansion of the power plant because they hadn ' t been paid since april . the expansion , which was to add 1 , 444 megawatts of capacity to the existing 740 megawatt capacity , and a 5 million - tons - a - year liquefied natural gas receiving terminal , is 95 percent complete . ` ` buyers may get a good price but they need $ 500 million to complete the project , ' ' said pradyumna kaul , an activist who ' s campaigned against dabhol for eight years . ` ` that is a lot of money for a project that ' s in distress and whose credibility is at its lowest ' ' with enron on the verge of collapse . awaiting ` response ' bses managing director r . v . shahi said he ' s waiting for a ` ` response ' ' from the lenders on the future course of action . ` ` they came to us with ( the project ) and our action will depend on what their approach is . ' ' bses hasn ' t set a price it would pay for the project , shahi said . ` ` we ' ve not reached that stage yet . ' ' tata power officials weren ' t available for comment . ` ` the equity value ( of enron ) will go down , helping potential buyers , but that does not solve the basic problem , that of high - cost power , ' ' godbole said . ` ` all parties linked with the project will have to make sacrifices ' ' to reduce the cost of power . dabhol ' s power charges in 2000 rose as high as 7 . 1 rupees , or 15 u . s . cents , a kilowatt - hour , compared with other suppliers ' rates of about 2 . 81 rupees . that led the electricity board to default on bills , and in may it stopped buying power from dabhol , saying it was too expensive . enron was one of the first major companies to enter india after the country ' s economy opened up to foreign investment in 1991 . it was awarded the contract to build the power plant 100 miles south of mumbai without competitive bidding . plant construction was delayed for about two years after public interest groups filed lawsuits against the project , on the grounds its power was too expensive . a state government reworked the contract just five months after scrapping it , a move that sparked accusations of the company bribing politicians in return for the contract - - a charge denied by all parties . enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 46 ( new york ) enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) ( updating with instinet share price , dividend payment . ) washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history , forcing the largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate billions of dollars in assets to pay creditors . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case filed in 1987 . under chapter 11 protection , enron officials could continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . an ` ` automatic stay ' ' under u . s . bankruptcy law would block debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . ` witches brew ' chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . shares , the most active in pre - market trading on instinet , gained 2 cents to 63 cents after plunging 85 percent yesterday . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . enron said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a declared dividend . the company is scheduled to pay a 12 . 5 - cent quarter dividend on dec . 20 ` black hole ' for investors now considering buying enron ' s bonds and other debts , a major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the company ' s value . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc . ` ` it ' s a black hole . ' ' deltec has no investment in enron , hindes said . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from 53 cents tuesday . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors , he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' ' enron ' s derivatives debt doesn ' t reveal market risk , nyt says 2001 - 11 - 29 07 : 32 ( new york ) houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp .

' s revised takeover came down to efforts to find $ 250 million or $ 500 million of enron assets that could serve as collateral for a new dynegy cash advance , it became clear that even enron ' s rescuer was demanding collateral and having trouble finding it , the times reported . unlike banks , enron had no federal deposit insurance to reassure customers when rumors spread that it was in trouble , the paper reported . enron ' s collapse is a reminder for participants in unregulated markets that their financial health must be beyond doubt . unregulated markets can be very profitable for those with market knowledge , as enron seemed to have . yet , when prices are visible to all , the value of that knowledge falls . new regulation can bring more openness , though it also can bring structures , like clearing systems that reassure traders they need to worry about the credit of those with whom they trade , the paper said .

' ' the same hubris reflected in skilling ' s boast paved the way for the company ' s disintegration , analysts said . enron asked shareholders to accept reports of 14 percent annual earnings growth , even as it used a bewildering series of outside partnerships to hedge risks and move assets and liabilities off its books . when accounting for those partnerships turned out to be wrong , investor confidence evaporated . standard & poor ' s , whose downgrade of enron ' s debt yesterday was part of the proposed sale ' s unraveling , removed the company from its index of 500 stocks . enron shares have lost more than 99 percent , or $ 45 billion in market value , making them the worst performer in the index this year . ` world ' s greatest company ' a sign at enron ' s headquarters calls it ` ` the world ' s greatest company , ' ' and for several years many investors agreed . enron ' s shares rose 50 percent in 1999 , 87 percent last year , and for most of 2001 were the most highly recommended analyst pick among s & p 500 companies . enron ' s high profile extended beyond wall street . the company accounted for a quarter of u . s . electricity and natural gas trades this year . lay attended a bush administration economic forum in january , and vice president richard cheney sought his advice on energy policy . enron , its political action committee and employees gave almost $ 2 . 5 million to federal candidates and political parties last year , with about 75 percent of the money going to republicans , according to campaign finance records . ` ` enron is aligned with all the texas energy exploration and production money , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an analyst at creditsights inc . ` ` they know how to do business . ' ' risky strategy in 1990 , lay hired skilling , who became a force behind the company ' s growth . he ripped away walls in enron ' s headquarters , built trading desks and transformed the company ' s regulated pipeline and utility units into a business that some analysts say resembles a hedge fund . enron reported 1999 profit of $ 893 million and $ 40 . 1 billion in revenue . that same year , enron expanded into water utilities , sewage treatment and trading space on fiber - optic telecommunication networks . shareholder lawsuits filed in the past month say those business were money losers from the start and that executives mislead investors about them . a junior executive in europe dreamed up an idea in 1999 for an internet trading site dealing paper , plastics and other commodities , in addition to the usual natural gas and electricity offerings . the site handled $ 50 billion in transactions in its first six months and more than $ 880 billion in trades in two years , 60 percent of the company ' s total . ` ` enron had a tremendous appetite for risk , ' ' said peter fusaro , president of global change associates , which did consulting for enron . ` ` they were the first in many markets , would take long - term contracts , they were just super - aggressive . they hired type - a mba ' s from the best schools who learned the energy business from scratch . ' ' investors in dark unknown by most investors , some of enron ' s increased revenue was coming from sales of power plants to enron - affiliated partnerships . those partnerships paid for the purchases by selling bonds that were guaranteed by enron . as a result , enron ' s books showed an increase in cash from the sales , and a decrease in debt associated with the plants . an enron restatement of finances earlier this month showed that as much as $ 3 . 9 billion , or about a quarter of enron ' s total long term debt , had been shifted from enron ' s books to affiliates . skilling quit the company in august . former enron chief financial officer andrew fastow was fired last month , after the company revealed that fastow had personally profited from transactions he conducted with enron partnerships . enron has said it ' s cooperating with an sec probe . when enron ' s market value was near its high in late 2000 and early this year , eight top enron executives , including lay and skilling , sold company stock for a total of $ 73 million . more than 20 securities lawsuits alleging illegal insider trading have been filed against the company . lay pledged to provide more information on enron ' s transactions , starting with the third - quarter earnings report . on oct . 16 , enron stunned analysts and investors with the disclosure of $ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments in businesses outside the main trading operation , such as in fiber - optics ventures and the azurix water and sewage companies . ` ` now you have a bankrupt company , ' ' said rob plaza , an analyst at financial advisers morningstar who owns no enron shares . ` ` that is the smoke and mirrors of enron .

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

3964,"re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison gotcha ! there are two separate fallacies in the argument against n-ary comparison which i discussed recently and which powers , delancey , and guy are now apparently seeking to defend . ( 1 ) janhunen says that the probability of a match occurring purely by chance when you compare japanese with four languages is four times what it is when you compare it with one language . this simply cannot be true because probabilities are values between 0 and 1 . if the probablity in the case of a binary comparison was say . 5 , then he would be predicting that it would be 2 in the case of n-ary comparison , which is impossible , because 2 is not between 0 and 1 . ( 2 ) the other fallacy is not purely mathematical , although i suspect that it involves elements of confusio . in any case , no one who argues for n-ary comparison ever talks about getting a match in 2 out of n languages . now , if we look at guy 's numbers , in his scenario of a 100 - word list with no shifted meanings , he came up with 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces in a binary comparison but only 5 . 8 when you are looking for a match between 3 out of 5 languages , 0 . 13 when you look for one between 4 out of 5 , and he does not give the much smaller number yet in the case of 5 out of 5 . i am not sure how jacques defines spurious and so i have not verified the numbers , but they are certainly on the right orders of magnitude . as you consider more and more languages ( also as the initial probability of a match declines , which usually happens as you go from toy models to real data ) , what happens is that you need fewer and fewer out of the n languages being compared to agree . thus , in guy 's example a match between n - 2 languages out of 5 was less likely to occur by chance than one between 2 out of 2 . but if n were 100 , i . e . , you were comparing 100 languages , then you would not need n - 2 ( i . e . , 98 ) languages to agree to be able to do better than with a binary comparison . it would be many many fewer ( although i do n't know how many since i do not know what formula jacques is using and what he is assuming about the initial probability of a match ) . maybe , he could kindly supply the numbers . and in light of all this , let us add another argument for rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered a mathematical demonstration that the relationships he proposed were unlikely to be due to chance , much less by doing a binary comparison of every pair of indo - european languages . which i think just goes to show how unrealistic the whole idea of doing such comparisons is . but if you do want to do them , then at least let us be clear about how to do them so as to minimize false positives ( i . e . matches due to chance and not really reflective of common origin ) as well as false negatives ( i . e . , failures to find genuine historical connections ) . on the second point , there are arguments that n-ary is better . alexis mr",0

15557,"otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets , designs and manufactures the buildings wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles installation and building renovation . symbol otc . bb gdvi recent price 13 . 5 cents management team philip hamilton , ceo and president mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this company from inception into one of californias largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater , california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . adam de bard , vice president mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as vice president and chief information officer of pacesetter industries . ronald kilpatrick , director of finance mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic and international development and management of major corporations . he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides venture capital to projects in the pacific rim . recent headlines global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 ) wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and geoi pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 ) wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 ) global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets from california modular company pr newswire ( thu , may 26 ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division implementing its fourth production line pr newswire ( thu , may 19 ) talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton , president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( tue , may 17 ) stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( mon , may 16 ) global diversified industries ' modular division billings total $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

15767,"I *like* corn..-------- Original Message -------- Subject: [interest] FWD: When a Crop Becomes King Date: Fri, 19 Jul 2002 10:14:23 -0400 (EDT) From: Donald Eastlake 3rd July 19, 2002 When a Crop Becomes King By MICHAEL POLLANCORNWALL BRIDGE, Conn. -- Here in southern New England the corn is already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun. The ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands, inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality.Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past 10,000 years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication. The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its enemies) so it might thrive.Corn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by Christopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to Europe and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal crop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the interests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has insinuated itself into our landscape, our food system and our federal budget.One need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served here. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a year to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to get rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3 to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for it Congress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its 125,000-square mile American habitat will go unchallenged.At first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but really it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those economic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors, factory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap corn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to farmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer Daniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world.Our entire food supply has undergone a process of ""cornification"" in recent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in Mexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the United States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us. Most of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a diet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of beef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on their digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to stave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred to tolerate corn not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why feed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal, thanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10 billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is plenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything from ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics.By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the development of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar aside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched from sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10 percent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners; the figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the corn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn qua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has become one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along with several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of corn eaters.So why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way domestication is supposed to work?The problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it. Though we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system is doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in this country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather than lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and marketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the market, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared.This would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also preliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is metabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more harmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet high in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels in men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much corn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed beef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef.We know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the health of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn hybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer than any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food crop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater and, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which carries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine life in a 12,000 square mile area.To produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts of oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas, pesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable, solar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge, inefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for every bushel.So it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our land than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York State. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign oil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system has produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can turning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether corn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us. ====== Michael Pollan is the author, most recently, of ""The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World."" http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student

visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than GoodSeptember 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 
 Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""
Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977HOW TO ADVERTISE

Comedy - 93min
Reviewer's Tilt (2)
 
Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music 
video industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins 
make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they 
send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh 
at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are 
greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. 
I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a 
resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, 
especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each 
other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's 
underground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant 
to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've 
ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll 
love this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa 
Monica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, 
prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie 
is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention 
on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy 
it anyway.

against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.> Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my

/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)Good luck,

8093,"review of arboreal for windows review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk",0
14724,"special issue machine translation : final call for papers final call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric "" equivalents "" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preuss et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ; geldbach 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? - multilingual anaphora resolution submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat anaphora special issue "" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1998 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield )",0

Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bellin FC98.Online copy here:http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white list. They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in recent message with:Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokensTheir idea of including the postage free-token in the email address, mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother migration for non-users. eg. you can use varied sender addresses and it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else and it will still work etc.They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- ""gatekeeper"" they call it.Adam--------------------------------------------------------------------- To unsubscribe, e-mail: camram-spam-unsubscribe@camram.org For additional commands, e-mail: camram-spam-help@camram.org--- end forwarded text--- end forwarded text -- ----------------- R.

"" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . "" there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . "" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow "" will be on a leave of absence from the company . "" he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that "" management does care "" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as "" an admission of guilt . "" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible "" death spiral "" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with "" trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street .

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a "" chinese wall "" existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "" informal inquiry "" into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a "" hold "" to a "" sell "" rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a "" sell "" recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price . "" we are concerned about what we don ' t know , "" ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals .

"" it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec , "" prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said wednesday . "" who knows ?

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role . "" i think change is good at this particular point in time , "" said fac equities analyst robert christensen said . "" i think andy was somewhat beleaguered . "" a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . "" i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , "" heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . "" there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , "" heim said . "" instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever . "" enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent .

"" this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis . "" previously , enron ' s managers have been "" cautious and defensive in their approach , "" he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim . "" i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , "" heim said . "" what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . "" the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . "" it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , "" he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . "" internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , "" feygin said .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the "" fastow era "" is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

Dec. 1, 2002KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.Hamano admits to the allegations.Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.-James Rogers

( normally this kind of software is several hundred dollars ) they even give you easy to understand , proven , step by step instructions for success with this program . in fact , they helped me get started and i ' m so thankful . it 's hard to believe that this as simple as it is , but it really is simple . you will even get support from them via email anytime you need it . you won't get this kind of help from other programs of this nature . it makes all the difference in the world . my name is anne bowman . i am 31 - year-old graduate student desperately trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field that is , if i am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market . like most people in this day and age , it is hard to make ends meet , and being a student does not help the situation at all ( if i ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese i think i would have to scream ) . i returned to school after having worked for several years with little potential for achieving what i had expected out of life . i figured if i returned to school and received my ph . d there would be several opportunities for me out there to achieve my goals . after seeing my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and , depressingly , not find respectable positions in their chosen field i began to think , "" oh no not again ! "" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? "" i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , "" why can't i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! "" i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" i have nothing to lose "" . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that "" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don ' t send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by the beginning of december , i had received 174 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee . "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" . well , i had 174 orders for report # 2 , 74 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by january 20th , of my emailing of 15 , 000 , i received $ 54 , 000 with more coming in ever day . the great thing about this program is you can begin the process over and over again without any limit on potential income ! i paid off all my student loans , and together with everything i have learned in school , i am now saving in order to open up my own business related to my field as soon as i graduate . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place on the list . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders of report # 1 and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry , it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . to my fellow graduate students out there , good luck to you and i sympathise . and to all other persons in financial trouble consider this letter a sign and please take advantage of this opportunity . you won ' t be disappointed ! sincerely , anne bowman the following testimonial was at the bottom of this letter but it was too good to leave down there so i moved it up here . it is exactly how i felt at first and feel now .

6406,"a few questions for you hi louise hope all is well and that your trip to and from london went smoothly ! a few questions : 1 . does enron have a system which collects data by customer ? we have something called cmis which we use for these purposes and which i believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don ' t have something already . we usually need customer info for reg reporting purposes . 2 . bob dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of sorts whereat the heads of gas and power trading present to key ubsw people what their businesses are all about , example trade flows , competitive pressures , key reg reporting requirements , etc . he would also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets . the thought is to try and do this on thursday because so many ubsw people will be on the ground in houston for the simulation exercise . i don ' t know that i am wedded to that day and i am a bit unsure about whether this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and i am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this once they start trading . what do you think ? the audience would include key logistics personnel from ubsw and enron and anyone else you thought appropriate . spoke with mike about it and he is fine . 3 . having ubsw paraphenalia sent down - toys , shirts , etc . , should be arriving by no later than tuesday . if you haven ' t received anything by late on monday could you let me know so i can track down . ubsw and ubsw energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both trading floors - they should arrive by wed . 4 . was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor on friday to commemorate the closing . what do you think ? 5 . i am planning to be down in houston for most of next week . i thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on friday . i will be leaving on a late monday flight and returning on a late afternoon friday flight . i hope you think this will be useful . please let me know otherwise . sorry for the long message . please feel free to call me at home or on my cell if you have any questions , issues , would like to discuss h 914 764 4597 c 917 523 6132 . colette visit our website at http : / / www . ubswarburg . com this message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . please notify the sender immediately by e - mail if you have received this e - mail by mistake and delete this e - mail from your system . e - mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error - free as information could be intercepted , corrupted , lost , destroyed , arrive late or incomplete , or contain viruses . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . if verification is required please request a hard - copy version . this message is provided for informational purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments .",0

sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.if-you're-out-to-make-a-quick-buck-you-don't-waste-a-second-on-hard-

collins : well , any time that a company goes through a short term period of troubles , the industry surrounding that , that has an intricate layer of credit relationships , is concerned about their ability to be paid . haffenreffer : but for people who don ` t know what enron does , what role do they play in the trading of natural gas futures ? collins : well , they are a major counter - party in the natural gas industry in trading , selling and distributing natural gas . and so , they have an extensive network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company in the north american industry . haffenreffer : are they involved , in some way , with almost every trade having to do with natural gas ? are they that big ? collins : no . i wouldn ` t say that they ` re involved with every trade . they ` re involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market making system . but , no , they ` re only a component of the market , and only do , perhaps , a percentage of what trades on the nymex . haffenreffer : so when trading takes place , and it ` s very fast , there ` s a lot of money changing hands all the time . there ` s a lot of credit given to people trading and when a company like enron has got some liquidity problems , or just even fears of liquidity problems , that can affect people who do trades with them . collins : yes . absolutely . it can cause people to retract from trading . it can cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading . it ` s not unlike the financial markets at all . when you have a serious credit concern . haffenreffer : as result , the nymex is working at a faster clip to get a clearing service set up . is that right ?

"" we have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors , "" cartel office spokesman stefan siebert told reuters . "" if they don ' t do that , then ultimately we could issue an injunction to force them to do so . "" the competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received complaints that grid operators bewag ( bklg . de , enbw , hew and veag that the four firms "" charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs "" for balancing energy . german grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such power in their grid areas , which they control by temporarily switching on and off their power plants . this poses a potential threat to other power suppliers . "" new entrants to the german market , such as london ' s enron capital & resources and hamburg ' s lichtblick , because of their small customer portfolios , cannot balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy groups can , "" the statement said . "" consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy ( and ) are threatened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it . "" the four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balancing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country ' s association agreement ( vv 2 ) , which is due to be modified by next year . "" illegal cartel conduct cannot be justified through the association agreement , "" said cartel office president ulf boege in the statement . "" references to the agreement show rather that there is an urgent need for action in vv 2 , which is currently being modified , to develop regulations on the accounting of balancing energy that conform with cartel law , "" he added . utilities rwe and e . on have introduced an auction system for their balancing energy needs to provide a market to other potential generators , as a condition of their respective mergers last year . rwe net ' s regulating power manager klaus albers said last week that the system it introduced in april , which is based on a cartel office model , had not so far produced the lower prices it was designed to . he said he expected all grid operators to introduce a market for their balancing energy needs within two years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0

At least that is the case when then language you used is available on

15813,"call for papers to the workshop connectionist - symbolic integration : from unified to hybrid approaches to be held at ijcai ' 95 montreal , canada august 19-20 , 1994 there has been a considerable amount of research in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . while such an approach has clear advantages , it also encounters serious difficulties and challenges . therefore , various models and ideas have been proposed to address various problems and aspects in this integration . there is a growing interest from many segments of the ai community , ranging from expert systems , to cognitive modeling , to logical reasoning . two major trends can be identified in the state of the art : these are the unified or purely and the hybrid approaches to integration . whereas the purely connectionist ( "" connectionist-to - the-top "" ) approach claims that complex symbol processing functionalities can be achieved via neural networks alone , the hybrid approach is premised on the complementarity of the two paradigms and aims at their synergistic combination in systems comprising both neural and symbolic components . in fact , these trends can be viewed as two ends of an entire spectrum . up till now , overall , there is still relatively little work in comparing and combining these fairly isolated efforts . this workshop will provide a forum for discussions and exchanges of ideas in this area , to foster cooperative work . the workshop will tackle important issues in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . a tentative schedule day 1 : a . introduction : * invited talks these talks will provide an overview of the field and set the tone for ensuing discussions . * theoretical foundations for integrating connectionist and symbolic processing b . definition of the two approaches : * do they exhaust the space of current research in connectionist-symbolic integration , or is there room for additional categories ? * how do we compare the unified and hybrid approaches ? * do the unified and hybrid approaches constitute a clearcut dichotomy or are they just endpoints of a continuum ? * what class of processes and problems is well-suited to unified or hybrid integration ? the relevant motivations and objectives . * what type of model is suitable for what type of application ? enumerate viable target domains . c . state of the art : * recent or ongoing theoretical or experimental research work * implemented models belonging to either the unified or hybrid approach * practical applications of both types of systems research addressing key issues concerning : * the unified approach : theoretical or practical issues involving systematicity , compositionality and variable binding , biologically inspired models , connectionist knowledge representation , other high-level connectionist models . * the hybrid approach : modes and methods of coupling , task sharing between various components of a hybrid system , knowledge representation and sharing . * both : commonsense reasoning , natural language processing , analogical reasoning , and more generally applications of unified and hybrid models . day 2 : d . cognitive aspects : * cognitive plausibility and relations to other ai paradigms * in cognitive modeling , why should we integrate connectionist and symbolic processing ? * is there a clear cognitive rationale for such integration ? ( we may need to examine in detail some typical areas , such as commonsense reasoning , and natural language processing ) * is there psychological and / or biological evidence for existing models ? if so , what is it ? e . open research issues : * can we now propose a common terminology with precise definitions for both approaches to connectionist-symbolic integration and for the location on the continuum ? * how far can unified systems go ? can unified models be supplemented by hybrid models ? can hybrid models be supplanted by unified models ? * limitations and barriers faced by both approaches * what breakthroughs are needed for both approaches ? * is it possible to synthesize various existing models ? workshop format - panel discussions - mini-group discussions : participants will break into groups of 7 / 8 to discuss a given theme ; group leaders will then form a panel to report on group discussions and attempt a synthesis with audience participation - interactive talks : this is a novel type of oral presentation we will experiment with . instead of a classical presentation , the speaker will present a problem or issue and give a brief statement of his personal stand ( 5 min ) to launch discussions which he will then moderate and conclude . - classical slide talks followed by q / a and discussions . workshop co - chairs : frederic alexandre , crin - cnrs / inria - lorraine ron sun , the university of alabama organizing committee : john barnden , new mexico state university steve gallant , belmont research inc . larry medsker , american university christian pellegrini , university of geneva noel sharkey , sheffield university program committee : lawrence bookman ( sun laboratory , usa ) michael dyer ( ucla , usa ) wolfgang ertel ( frw , germany ) limin fu ( university of florida , usa ) jose gonzalez - cristobal ( upm , spain ) ruben gonzalez - rubio ( university of sherbrooke , canada ) jean - paul haton ( crin - inria , france ) melanie hilario ( university of geneva , switzerland ) abderrahim labbi ( imag , france ) ronald yager ( iona college , usa ) schedule : - the submission deadline for participants is february 1 , 1995 . - the authors and potential participants will be notified the acceptance decision by march 15 , 1995 . - the camera-ready copies of working notes papers will be due on april 15 , 1995 submission : - if you wish to present a talk , specify the preferred type of presentation ( classical or interactive talk ) and submit 5 copies of an extended abstract ( within the limit of 5 - 7 pages ) to : ron sun department of computer science the university of alabama tuscaloosa , al 35487 rsun @ cs . ua . edu ( 205 ) 348-6363 - if you only wish to attend the workshop , send 5 copies of a short ( no more than one page ) description of your interest to the same address above . - please be sure to include your e-mail address in all submissions .",0

7462,"midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal "" freeze - up , "" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the "" commercial "" in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

11513,"re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis , it may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in "" out "" , "" house "" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in "" oat "" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in "" right "" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between "" writer "" and "" rider "" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in "" eight "" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that "" sorry "" rhymes with "" story "" . this is rare for the words "" sorry "" , "" sorrow "" , "" borrow "" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for "" forest "" , "" orange "" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that 's enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n't want to make anything out of the fact that he 's american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n't hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t 's , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .",0

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . mb nlz",1

560,"Hello -You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""Tim, enter my name for a free membership.""Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.That's all there's to it.We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.Looking forward to hearing from you!Sincerely, Tim HopkinsP.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: sj95@yahoo.com with

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 *true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 Net or off.
 
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 I have to blush & say ...
 
Persistence and personality.
 
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
the Bank. Get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . 
 But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 
That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
Talk about SIMPLE!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

-------------------------------------------------
Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

 consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 I have to blush & say ...
 
Persistence and personality.
 
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
the Bank. Get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . 
 But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 
That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
Talk about SIMPLE!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

6957,"thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . "" i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , "" says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as "" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . "" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : "" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . "" and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was "" immaterial "" to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . "" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , "" concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .",0

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and
they're not all in /etc either...> Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &

someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...Conor

GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxamanâ„¢.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
 Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Â 
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

By Yonder Blessed Moon, Sleuths Decode Life and Art
By LEON JAROFFOn its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian, where it had
delivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,
the heavy cruiser Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine
I-58 and sent to the bottom of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the
worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200
crew members survived.Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic
story a startling new twist.It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they
write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made
the sinking possible.Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as
well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the
submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58
surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,
they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship
silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six
torpedoes sent it to the bottom.""It was sheer chance,"" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. ""Without
that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the
cruiser, especially at that distance.""With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a
university honors course called ""Astronomy in Art, History and
Literature."" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place
of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of
astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the
moon in military and other encounters.Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright
star in van Gogh's ""White House at Night."" He and some students went to
Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched
until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters
from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was
completed in June 1890.Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where
van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,
and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had
been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then
identified the ""star."" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June
had occupied that part of the sky.A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van
Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the
middle of the month that year.Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the
opening of ""Hamlet,"" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the
""star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that
part of heaven where now it burns."" From the guards' description, the
season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright
stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the
constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly
inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star,
for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,
creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would
certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed
by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the
source of some of his best-known plays.Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that
night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other
astronomy-based sleuthing.Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his
negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic
""Moon and Half Dome."" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found
Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the
moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak
and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at
4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical
at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law
visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of ""Moon and the
Half Dome"" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual
moon and the Half Dome.Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly
rapid movement of the moon described in ""The Merchant's Tale"" occurred
in April 1389. And in ""The Franklin's Tale,"" Chaucer's description of
the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the
Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur
astronomer.Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,
how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit
night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that,
while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the
southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat.Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining ""the tide that failed""
in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.
Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over
a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with
drafts of at least four feet, to pass.But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, ""the ocean
just sat there,"" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a
mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge
of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600
yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun
fire from the Japanese.Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six
months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the
military planners were aware that they had to contend with a ""neap""
tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its
first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes
water levels to deviate less.But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth
and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed
and the marines in trouble.""I'm not in the least blaming the planners,"" Dr. Olson said, explaining
that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been
applied to the waters at Tarawa.Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, ""We can
calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.""Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his
interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. ""I have thought
about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,"" he says, ""and that has
made my life as a scientist much richer.""

1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5
for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So
we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.I think I might be missing some details of what you're peeved about,
though... could you elaborate specifically?

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:> I don't see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan's

its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that

of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle

and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------

18074,"_ rightward movement _ review - - i [ editor 's note : this is part one of a two part review . the second part appears in the next issue of linguist ] beerman , dorothee , david leblanc , & henk van riemsdijk , eds . ( 1997 ) rightward movement ( linguistik aktuell 17 ) amsterdam : benjamins . 406 pp . this is a proceedings volume collecting together papers presented in oct . 1995 at the tilburg conference on rightward movement . the editors mention two or three papers that were presented at the conference but were not including in this proceedings volume . i say ` two or three ' because , although they mention three authors ( kayne , koike , and truckenbrodt ) , koike actually has a paper in this volume ; i do not know why his name is included in the list of authors whose papers were not included . at the back of the book , a complete list of addresses ( snail - and e-mail ) of the contributors is included . the editors ' preface ( with van riemsdijk named as principal author ) provides a very nice summary of the relevant issues and their background in the literature . special note is taken of repercussions of recent work in minimalist program ( e . g . , kayne 1994 ) for the whole notion of ` rightward movement ' ( hereafter rm ) . this reviewer would note in particular that , although it is commonly supposed that , as stated in the preface , ` in a minimalist approach , movement is exclusively triggered by checking . . . . given this new line of thinking , rightward movement simply cannot be triggered , hence it cannot exist ' , some of the contributors - - e . g . , alphonce & davis , buring & hartmann - - demonstrate that it is in fact possible to develop hypotheses within the minimalist framework that would enable triggering of such movement . of the 14 papers in the collection , it is hardly surprising that 7 deal with ` extraposition ' ( defined in various ways ) , and four of those are concerned primarily with one aspect or other of extraposition in german . i will discuss these extraposition papers as a group before considering the others . josef bayer 's paper ` cp - extraposition as argument shift ' ( pp . 37-58 ) begins with a very nice , neat summary of problems with classical extraposition account ( via rm ) for postverbal cps in v - final languages ( focussing particularly on bengali , hindi , and german ) , noting that these problems disappear under a kayne - type analysis . however , he goes on to note definite empirical problems with a kayne - type analysis . he then proposes an analysis according to which a complement is right-adjoined to the maximal projection of its governing head ( in this case vp ) , leaving behind a trace as sole sister of that head ( v ) . if that trace is then deleted and the tree is pruned , the v ends up with a complement to its right which it can theta-mark . alternatively , bayer suggests , at least some ` extraposed ' cps may be base-generated to the right , co-indexed with a ( dummy / deletable ) pronominal , by inheritance from which they are licensed . bayer notes that this would help account for the fact that in some ov languages ( e . g . , bengali ) , certain classes of cps are * always * ` extraposed ' . if we assume that directionality is relevant to selection , then the resulting vp constitutes a barrier to a cp on the ` non-canonical ' side of the head , which would account for the scope effects bayer notes earlier as being problematic for both the traditional account and the kayne - type account . in ` rightward scrambling ' ( pp . 186-214 ) , anoop mahajan argues on the basis of various relations sensitive to c-command that postverbal nominal arguments in hindi are merely constituents left behind while everything else has moved leftwards . this analysis supersedes the rm analysis he proposed in an unpublished paper ten years ago and is deliberately consistent with an analysis based on kayne 's linear correspondence axiom ( hereafter lca ) . this reviewer notes that many of mahajan 's arguments necessarily presuppose certain possibly dubious tacit assumptions , e . g . , that rm must necessarily involve adjunction specifically to ip ( contrary to the approach proposed in , e . g . , muller 's , wiltschko 's , and rochemont & culicover 's papers ) . for instance , the string in mahajan 's ( 33 ) , which he marks ( ? ? ? ) could be generated - - and its unacceptability accounted for - - by right-adjunction of the direct object to vp rather than ip . nowhere does mahajan actually address what in this reviewer 's opinion is the most basic issue with questions like this : is there or is there not any evidence of a * gap * corresponding to the postverbal material ? michael s . rochemont & peter w . culicover in ` deriving dependent right adjuncts in english ' ( pp . 279-300 ) discuss various constructions in english , all of which might be included under a rather broadly-defined concept of ` extraposition ' . distinguishing between the extraposition of relative clauses on the one hand and heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion on the other , they argue that relative - clause extraposition is best treated as ( 1 ) base - generated and ( 2 ) right-adjunction to the governing category ( vp , ip , or cp ) of the antecedent to the extraposed rc . they make an effort to conjure up plausible analyses of rc - extraposition involving kayne - style leftward-movement but note that none of the possibilities they consider are quite satisfactory . even the ` best ' option , involving movement of both the rc and its antecedent to distinct spec positions , fails to provide any motivation for either the posited movement or the highly ramified structure such an analysis requires . expanding on earlier work of their own ( rochemont & culicover 1990 ) , rochemont & culicover argue that heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion are best treated as instances of movement to a right - adjoined a ' - position . they demonstrate that , quite apart from the problems discussed in rochemont & culicover 1990 , any attempt to analyze such constructions by means of exclusively leftward movement involves the extremely unattractive movement of what is not , in fact , by any stretch of the imagination a recognizable constituent . in the end , they acknowledge that there are some empirical problems shared by both the rightward-movement account they apparently prefer and the ` movement to high specifier ' account that would be more consistent with a kayne - type approach , but that the latter raises some provoking theoretical problems that are absent from their rightward-movement account . they conclude by saying that ` the question whether rightward movement exists or not . . . is not an empirical one . ' daniel buring & katharina hartmann 's paper ` the kayne mutiny ' ( pp . 59-80 ) presents an excellent argument for the empirical bankruptcy of the kayne antisymmetry hypothesis . making crucial use of reconstruction at lf and of binding - theoretic statements referring to ( undeleted ) traces , b&h 's argument is built upon the prediction that , if extraposition is a consequence of rm , it ought to be possible for a proper binding relation * not * to exist between an np and a cp later in the sentence - - if the np happens to be in a hierarchically lower position , from which neither it nor any of its daughters is able to c-command the cp ( such a lack of binding relation is a priori impossible in a kayne analysis , according to which any np to the left of a cp must ipso facto c-command it ) . they then demonstrate that such binding failures are in fact attested , and are indeed not all that difficult to come up with in a language like german . ( at the end of section 2 , they acknowledge some confusing results with regard to coreference options , concluding that these ` require further investigation ' . ) they further demonstrate ( section 3 ) that the kayne analysis actually does serious violence to many standard assumptions about movement , including ( similarly to rochemont & culicover ) issues of what qualifies as a ( movable ) constituent and under what circumstances a constituent may be ` stranded ' . ( it 's from this surreptitiously iconoclastic character of kayne 's hypothesis that they get their clever title . ) and they demonstrate that verb - topicalization ought to be impossible in a kayne analysis , although of course it 's quite common in german . in order to account for the complications with regard to island - constraint violations , etc . that have presented problems for earlier versions of a rm - analysis of extraposition in german and similar languages , b&h propose ( p . 72 ) a generalization according to which finite clauses may never be governed by either v or i . this provides an actual motivation for cp - extraposition , since presumably in its ds position a complement clause is governed by the matrix verb , and in order to escape that government must be right-adjoined to some higher phrasal node , presumably ip . this is in direct conflict with bayer 's analysis , according to which the extraposed cp ends up being governed by the matrix verb as a result of the deletion of its own trace and tree-pruning ; which analysis is to be preferred ought to be an empirical problem . hubert haider 's paper ` extraposition ' ( 115-152 ) argues on the basis of the extraposition of comparatives and the c-command relations essential thereto in english and german ( mostly german ) that extraposed constituents remain embedded in their ds mothers . haider further argues that extraposed relative and argument clauses must also be vp - internal , since although they are n't subject to the same c-command relations themselves , they always come * before * extraposed comparatives which are . broadening his scope in section 2 to other examples of german extraposition , haider demonstrates that they can't result from movement and must therefore be base-generated . but , on the basis of scope , c-command , and absence of island-effects , he also argues against an analysis in terms of base-generated adjunction . haider agrees with kayne in assuming exclusive leftward movement ; however , he allows for either head-initial or head-final base structures , and invokes head movement while kayne invokes phrasal movement . haider presents several predictions that kayne 's lca theory would have for a language such as german , which he then demonstrates are all falsified by the actual data : ( 1 ) phrases to the left of the verb should be in spec - positions , and should therefore be islands ( 2 ) vp - adverbials and predicates should end up in postverbal position , since there 's nothing to trigger their movement ( 3 ) vp - topicalization ought to involve the movement of a functional projection containing a trace of the finite verb . in ` extraposition as remnant movement ' ( p . 215-246 ) , gereon muller offers a very neat analysis of extraposition in german as right - adjunction to a variety of phrasal nodes , including cp as well as vp or ip , thereby accounting for various otherwise problematic details with regard to island effects in both leftward - and rightward-moved constituents . the paper includes a very interesting and useful comparative discussion of the adequacy of a variety of different proposed constraints for excluding unacceptable strings while allowing acceptable ones . martina wiltschko 's paper , ` extraposition , identification and precedence ' ( pp . 358-396 ) , a summary of her 1995 wien dissertation , discusses extraposition in german , focussing on the relation of * identification * between the ` identifyee ' , the ( pro ) nominal element ( np or dp ) in the canonical position within the clause and the ` identifier ' , the extraposed constituent . both identifyee and identifier provide linguistically necessary information : the identifyee occupies a canonical ( theta - ) position , therefore satisfying syntactic requirements , while the identifier provides necessary semantic content to licence the identifyee 's definiteness . given that the identifyee * introduces * a discourse referent , it must ( on the basis of heim 's ( 1980 ) novelty condition ) precede the identifier . wiltschko also argues for a locality constraint on identification , according to which the identifier must c-command the identifyee , without any intervening xp ; thus , the identifier must be right-adjoined to the minimal maximal projection dominating the identifyee . in wiltschko 's view , these two constraints together account for the fact that identifiers are always extraposed . she acknowledges that this analysis apply only to * restrictive relative clauses * , not to other types of modifiers . attractive as the paper is in many ways , it suffers somewhat from the necessary exclusion of many supporting arguments , for which the interested reader is referred to the full-length dissertation . two of the papers are concerned primarily with parsing theory and the development of adequate parsing technology . both of these papers , coming from different points of view , argue for a data-driven , bottom-up parsing strategy as against a hypothesis-driven top-down strategy . in ` on movement and one - pass no backtrack parsing ' ( pp . 301-330 ) , chris sijtsma recognizes that ` natural ' ( i . e . , single-pass , no backtracking , faithful to derivation ) bottom-up parsers are less restrictive than natural top-down parsers , which of course from the point of view of strict generative theory is a point against them , but assumes that there is enough variation among actual languages that a bottom-up parsing strategy is to be preferred . this reviewer finds such a conclusion attractive , but worries that sijtsma has provided so little in the way of empirical demonstration to back it up ; indeed , for such a mathematically-oriented paper ( at least relative to this reviewer 's experience ) , there is extremely little in the way of solid argument presented ; most of the time , sijtsma merely asserts that the proof of any given theorem is either self-evident or readily derivable ; in a few cases , he refers to demonstrations elsewhere in the literature . another issue both of these papers consider very seriously , without , however , either of them coming up with a very satisfactory solution , is the proper size of the look - ahead window for an adequate parser . sijtsma asserts ( pp . 305 - 6 ) that any grammar with a look-ahead window greater than 1 is functionally equivalent to a grammar that looks ahead just one symbol , but then goes on to say , ` in practice we still need . . . parsers that look ahead more than one symbol . ' in subsequent discussion it becomes clear that he is unclear just how large a look - ahead window is empirically adequate . likewise , alphonce & davis , while currently working with a look-ahead window of ` at most two chunks ' ( p . 25 ) , are clearly dissatisfied with this characterization . it is clear that this issue needs more thought , if not further research , devoted to it . a fundamental claim of the paper by carl alphonce & henry davis , ` motivating non - directional movement ' ( pp . 7-36 ) , is that linear precedence constraints , indeed lp phenomena of any kind , have no relevance for syntax at all ; essentially , they claim that , from the point of view of all syntactic levels including lf , constituents are organized hierarchically in terms of dominance relations but not linearly in terms of precedence relations . in alphonce & davis ' view , all precedence relations are imposed at pf , making them essentially matters of performance rather than competence . in the opinion of this reviewer , this is a very interesting and possibly attractive idea . unfortunately , contrary to the promise contained in the abstract , this claim is not so much argued for as assumed within the paper . nor is it made clear - - to this reviewer , anyway - - that it is explicitly argued for anywhere else , unlike the skipped arguments behind wiltschko 's paper and the citations given in sijtsma 's paper . alphonce & davis merely demonstrate that it is possible to develop an analytic approach - - more precisely , a parsing program - - that has no need for any kind of explicit syntactic constraints , at any level ( whether ug or language-particular ) , making reference to linear order . at the end of their abstract , alphonce & davis claim that they are motivated by a conviction that ` it is a priori desirable to eliminate as much redundancy as possible between different components of the system . . . . if some phenomena has [ sic ] an independent processing explanation we hold that syntactic theory should not have to offer any explanation for it . ' this approach is all very well in a purely formal mathematical system , but it is fairly common knowledge that redundancy is in fact a sine qua non of biological systems ( cf . e . g . gould 1993 ) and of natural-linguistic systems as well ( cf . e . g . hock 1986 , ch . 9 & 12 ; this fact is also acknowledged by chris sijtsma in his paper , p . 314 ) . the mere fact that one can develop a parsing program that has no need to appeal to syntactic lp constraints , therefore , in no way demonstrates that such constraints have no place in human natural-language competence . much of sijtsma 's paper is devoted to developing points ( regarding , e . g . , the proper type ( s ) and subcategorization frame ( s ) of pps ) that are clearly relevant to his primary concern , which is developing an adequate automated parsing grammar , but are tangential to the focus of the collection . in arguing , contrary to kayne , that ug does not stipulate one universal tree-structure for all languages , sijtsma gets a fair amount of mileage out of replacing the assumption that node-labels are atomic with the assumption that they are merely shorthand for feature-bundles . though he does n't mention this , this replacement has actually been implicit in x - bar theory ever since the early 70 's . with regard to directionality of movement , sijtsma argues that rightward movement must be allowed by ug , with this caveat : in deriving ss from ds , leftward movement is unrestricted but rightward movement of modifiers ( which do n't leave obvious gaps ) should not exceed the look-ahead buffer ; on the other hand , in deriving lf from ss rightward movement is unrestricted but leftward [ editor 's note : this review is continued in the next issue of linguist ] - steven schaufele , ph . d . , asst . prof . of linguistics , english department soochow university , waishuanghsi campus , taipei 11102 , taiwan , roc ( 886 ) ( 02 ) 2881-9471 ext . 6504 fcosw5 @ mbm1 . scu . edu . tw http : / / www . prairienet . org / ~ fcosws / homepage . html * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",0

Some central site to make them available to the rest of the world, every time there's a ""apt-get update""?  :)    Also- I noticed this repo has about an 8K bandwidth.  Is there a way I can put this behind the others, so I don't hammer it for things that are at other repos?  I'm respectful about bandwidth, having lived on dialup for so long.

The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 20, 2002Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.Somebody's watching youYou better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.Also of note

18152,"more on human subjects a number of months ago i raised the issue of dealing with human subjects committees , since our department was being ( as we perceived it ) hassled by our own committee . i received numerous responses , which i have since forwarded to the lsa social issues ( or something ) committee . the responses varied from shocked outrage that anyone would look over our ( collective ) shoulders from shocked outrage that i would consider doing any research without asking permission . the primary hassle , which was reflected again in the more recent posting on the subject , is that linguistic research normally involves using a tape recorder . federal guidelines require ( so i am told ) a special , and more complex class of review if the data is being taped . in our case , this involves a full committee review , which takes two to three weeks , rather than the ` expedited ' review , which takes only a few days . we are still negotiating on whether class projects need to be cleared class by class ( which we hope ) or instead , student by student . given that students normally take at least half a semester to discover what they want to do , if it will then require an additional two or three weeks to get permission to do it , much linguistic classroom research may get halted . i would be greatly interested in hearing from people on the list who have been able to persuade their human subjects committees to issue any kind of ` blanket ' permission for certain kinds of research . when we suggested this possibility we were told that nobody 's research was privileged , and that if { sociology , psychology anthropology . . . } had to go through the process , so did we . in any case , as a result of my attempting to be law abiding , i almost lost an informant , whose data i had recorded illegally . i asked him to recite the nursery rhymes , then requested permission to do so . shortly afterwards , he left town , never to be seen again . sigh . . . any suggestions on getting expedited reviews , blanket permissions , other speeded up ways of being permitted to tape record linguistic data without supreme court approval would be appreciated . geoff nathan < ga3662 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > southern illinois university at carbondale",0

5112,"did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still. There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before.A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly adequate.It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of writing to RAID4 or RAID5... I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?Glenn Everhart -----Original Message----- From: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com] Sent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 3:04 PM To: Webappsec Securityfocus.Com; SECPROG Securityfocus Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks Hi,I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine.This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.htmlCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know? I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime.Thanks for any opinions, Ben ********************************************************************** This transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Markoffcharney!_)[1] http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/23/antiglobal_geeks/index.html

    the account  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
    from them etc.  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting

8473,"                   Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
ï¿½...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.
 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - DiscussDave deflects what he can't take the time to understand
It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.What Dave does is just the opposite.Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...
The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?
It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""
Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them. 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss
When's a Permalink not a Permalink?
When Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to
nothing at that point. So apparently the ""perma-"" part in permalink is
permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!

840,"When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.But you knew that.When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
aren't any.If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop
them or you from pretending otherwise.

More like Apple's implementation - the Gconf2 files are bog-standard 
XML, should you feel tempted to edit it by hand :)There are some possibilities that using standardised configuration tools 
provide: the ability to centrally manage a large number of computers - 
something like Windows' group policy. Although that would require other 
applications to use GConf as well .Haven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the 
fact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB 
ADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have 
to do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it 
for its config tools.Regards,Michel__________________________________________________

        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.Here is what I got:OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME

as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?Dave.

NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.

17340,"review : scobbie : autosegmental representation scobbie , james m . ( 1997 ) autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework , garland press , new york . [ revision of 1991 phd dissertation , university of edinburgh ] [ * ] michael hammond university of arizona jim scobbie 's dissertation , recently published in the outstanding dissertations in linguistics series through garland press , is an excellent example of a pre - optimality - theory attempt at a constraint-based phonology that has received insufficient attention in the phonological community . this is extremely unfortunate , as the thesis makes a number of interesting proposals that are well worth considering today . the dissertation is not in the usual vein of american phonology theses . it 's not an in-depth analysis of some particular array of data . rather , it appears to fit a much more european template , with more attention paid to placing the author 's proposal in the context of previous ideas . despite this very different approach , there is much to recommend it . the general hypothesis pursued is that phonological generalizations and representations are best cast as attribute-value structures . these formal devices are drawn from the hpsg ( head - driven phrase - structure grammar ) literature ( pollard & sag , 1987 ) . the basic idea is that dominance is expressed as something roughly equivalent to a featural distinction . for example , in a standard phonological representation the fact that a vowel might be high is expressed by assigning the vowel a ' + ' for a feature [ high ] , e . g . [ + high ] . expressed in attribute-value formalism , the attribute [ high ] has the value ' + ' . hpsg goes one step further and encodes dominance in the same fashion . thus , the fact that a syllable has a [ + high ] nucleus is expressed by positing a nucleus attribute for a syllable element and then allowing the nucleus attribute to itself have [ + high ] as an attribute-value pair . ( 1 ) the formal object above denotes a syllable with a [ + high ] nucleus . ( i ' ve indicated irrelevant information with ellipses . ) in the context of these representations , scobbie 's central claim is that autosegmental association can be formalized as dominance in an attribute-value structure . phonological representations also encode linear order , but in scobbie 's theory , linear order is formalized only for root nodes ( and is indicated with indices ) . a string of segments would then be represented as a set of indexed root matrices , essentially of the following sort . ( 2 ) indices are ordered by the relation immediate precedence ' ' . [ 1 ] with these structures , scobbie goes further and suggests that phonological rules should be traded in for constraints . these constraints , he suggests , are formally indistinct from the representations they apply to . ( a rather similar position has been advanced in ot . see russell , 1995 and hammond , to appear . ) for example , a generalization excluding mid nasal vowels would be expressed as follows . ( 3 ) such an expression rules out an element which is simultaneously specified [ - low ] , [ - high ] , and [ + nasal ] . constraints do n't actually "" apply "" to representations . rather , scobbie proposes , constraints are unified with representations . unification allows to representations to meld , just so long as they do n't conflict . for example , a representation consisting solely of ifferent elements . for example , the index variables below indicate that the two matrices share the token value for a , but merely share the type value for b . ( 6 ) scobbie develops this formalism in a number of ways . first , he argues that representations like the one above are subject to what he calls the sharing constraint ( p . 93 ) . ( 7 ) sharing constraint if a structure is dominated by two paths of type p with indices i and j , where , then for every index n where there is a path dominating m . the immediate effect of this is to rule out cases where noncontiguous root elements share a token value . scobbie argues that the evidence for such cases is weak . ( cf . a very similar proposal in archangeli & pulleyblank , 1994 . ) a more interesting consequence is that scobbie uses this constraint in an attempt to derive the no - crossing constraint ( ncc ) , part of goldsmith 's ( 1976 ) more general well - formedness condition on autosegmental representations . this is the constraint that rules out crossing autosegmental association lines . sagey ( 1986 ; 1988 ) first proposes to derive the ncc from a treatment of autosegmental association as overlap . however , hammond ( 1988 ) argues that this notion is formally problematic proposing a different characterization of association as a transitive , irreflexive , and asymmetric relation . hammond 's approach , however , does not derive the ncc without stipulation . scobbie 's approach also involves an asymmetric characterization of association ( as dominance ) , but does derive the ncc . scobbie 's derivation of the ncc is based on the assumption that there are no contour values . that is , while two different root nodes might share a value token as in the second picture below , one root node cannot bear two different values , as in the first picture below ( where "" s "" indicates a segment or root node and "" t "" indicates a tone or value token ) . ( 8 ) this is a necessary position given his formalization of sequencing : only root nodes bear an index for linear position ; nonroot tokens are unsequenced . ( a similar position is developed in heiberg , in prep . ) were contour values to be allowed , there would be no way to distinguish their ordering . on the other hand , when two root nodes share a value , their ordering is distinguished in terms of indices , as in ( 6 ) . the upshot of the prohibition on contours is that violations of the ncc can only arise when there is an independent sharing violation . that is , ncc violations look like ( 9 ) , and ( 9 ) necessarily includes a sharing violation . ( 9 ) this is a very nice result , but comes at the cost of i ) ruling out discontinuous association , and ii ) excluding contour values . scobbie also argues that his approach allows him to derive the phenomenon of geminate integrity ( hayes , 1986 ; schein & steriade , 1986 ) . the basic idea of geminate integrity is that geminates resist epenthesis . ( see guerssel , 1977 ; 1978 for an early treatment and suh , 1997 for a recent proposal . ) the standard account of this is that geminates resist epenthesis because the result would entail crossing association lines , and a violation of the ncc , as in ( 9 ) above . the problem with this , as noted by scobbie and others as well , is that if the epenthetic vowel is featureless ( 10 ) or inserted on another tier ( 11 ) , then no violation of the ncc occurs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) scobbie 's own proposal is simple and direct . epenthesis into a geminate structure results in a violation of sharing , regardless whether the epenthetic vowel has features or whether its features might appear on some other tier . scobbie goes on to consider the possibility that geminate inalterability might also follow from the sharing constraint , but here his proposal is a lot more speculative . the basic idea pursued is that geminate inalterability results from default rules . the problem is that scobbie does n't really offer a clear proposal on the nature of default rules . on the face of it , they would seem to be a glaring problem for the monotonic theory he proposes . in his final substantive chapter , scobbie treats the problem of long-distance association , as in , e . g . arabic verbal morphology . he offers some well-taken criticisms of the traditional autosegmental approach , but does not really offer an explicit declarative counterproposal . in sum , this book is well worth reading . it offers a very interesting alternative constraint-based view of phonology with much to recommend it . on the other hand , there are a number of unresolved questions . what about floating segments ? scobbie speculates on this , but offers no satisfying solution . as noted above , contour segments are also ruled out , though the evidence for these in the tonal domain is unimpeachable .

17461,"So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.Geesh.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.ukThe books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.Cheers,

I'm not sure what you mean by ""let's you and him fight"", but it is 
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I 
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a ""loose confederation"" of 2 
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The 
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.Owen",0

_________________________________________________""[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.        ""First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .        ""The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.        ""A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .        ""There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.        ""(1) He considers himself a genius.        ""(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .        ""(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .        ""(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .        ""(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .""

8929,">>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK  Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims.  A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.  Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

16937,"Mornin' all,
	Last night, i was involved in an epic struggle to write a shell
script to do a certain task. The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad
to inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:
	It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of
cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:	mkfifo io
	cmd1  io
	
and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
can be done using something like:	exec 3>&1
	cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
	exec 3>&-but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is
mine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the
aim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new
mail on an imap server.Steve

each tube contains an uneven distribution of stuff that only /peaks/

in that neighbourhood is warped like a cheese-grater.  We can expect
one (or more) really big mother(s), surrounded by lots of cute little

bigger rocks are on the outer edge of the tubes: Relativistic effects
on the redshift/blueshift of the particle solar heating differential
on either side of each bit slow the smaller less-massive (and more
easily pushed) particles dropping them into lower orbits ... or at
least, that's our best theory.--

"" ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( i live in a little hsiang just behind the school - - "" hsiang "" being the chinese for a little alley connected to a main street ) . and having to apologize and reexplain . . . but i mainly switch between the languages , and there is little chance i create my own pidgin or creole . . . so do many taiwanese ( min-nan ) speaking people in the south of the island . . . so does it not mean that the evolution should depend on the education level of people - so that it would be differential inside a society according to , say , the social class ? there is probably as well a "" critical mass effect "" ( if france was turned into some chinese-dominant state . . . ) . is not our idea of "" homogeneity "" in evolution vitiated by the pretention of modern nation-states to generate a "" super-culture "" - through linguistic homogeneisation ? ) - i am also aware of phenomenons of resistance to acculturative evolution ( conscious or not ) as for the quebecquois telling , not "" un hot-dog "" as the french do , but "" un chien chaud "" ( toubon being in my opinion but a marginal impedement on the natural evolution , whatever direction it takes ) . . . - another exemple of the complexity of those issue would be the "" rigidification "" of a language facing a threat . it was given to me as an explanation when i was a student of kurdish , when i learnt that this language has in common with old persian an "" ergative "" ( ? ) construction for transitive verbs in past tenses , which was presented to me as a "" quite - passive "" construction . to allow for comparisons by more knowledgeable people , i will explain a little : there , the infix representing the agent is appended at the end of the verb , while the infix representing the subject is appended after the object , as : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xuward - 0 ( - eke and ek ( [ ^ e ] k ) being suffixes expressing definiteness ( eke = the ) ( child-the apple-one - he ate ) and indefiniteness respectively ( ek = a ) ) here , - y represents the child , - 0 a null infix ( there is only one apple ) , so "" the child ate the apples "" would be : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xiward-n < - - - - "" - n "" : there are several apples ( child-the apples-the - he ate-them ) so i was told at this time that this construct , which was used in old persian ( and is still used in the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan , is an archaic construction , characteristic of the periphery of the indo-iranian domain , that is , in kurdistan ( south-kurmandji , or sorani-speaking part ) , and also among the baluches , and represents a rigidification of the language due to a threat from other languages , ( so that languages at a domain periphery would sometimes evolve more slowly ) and that it has disappeared from standard modern persian . . . i would want to know if all that is still considered true , though . what do you think of it ? i guess there are as well different levels of evolution taking place simultaneously , that can be contradictory ( phonology , vocabulary , syntax . . . ) . anyway , i see several reasons why it should be difficult to infer any "" linear "" evolution of languages ( whatever fascination i feel when i read posts speaking of modelisations of 10 or 20 000 years back . . . ) on anything else that a case-by - case basis ( or does the fact that populations densities has obviously undergone a dramatic change since then , changing the dynamics of contacts . . . ? ? ? ? ) . to resume my questions : how can we ascertain that this language has had this reaction without having to resort to extra-linguistic implicit hypothesis as : homogeneity through classes , identity of evolution whatever the number of speakers would be ( lng-switching vs creolisation . . . ) , existence ( or not ) , type , and evolution of a scripting system ( * * ) etc . . . ? as i told , i am no linguist , ( neither "" linguistician "" nor philologist : ) , so i hope i did not waste your time , thus getting all your community angry at me ( ack ! - terrible perspective ) . but i will be very interested to read more about all this . friendly to all , gerard gautier ( * * ) once more , kurdish would be a good case in point , as it uses up to three different scripting systems according to the place ( latin , arabo-persian , cyrillic for the north-kurmandji , and latin and arabo-persian for sorani ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ wen-tzao school | \ | / / gerard gautier of foreign languages | / \ \ | . . \ | \ | | _ _ > | _ / \ _ > o _ _ _ > kaohsiung - taiwan _ / _ / . . _ / ( _ s . . _ / gauier @ cc . nsysu . edu . tw ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~",0

The online content business.Dear Friends,The online content business is doing fantastic.
Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With 
advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.
However,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 U.S.  consumers spent $675 millionÂ on paidÂ online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online
Publishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  Look at these success stories:
New York Times Digital has 
been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and 
registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.
TheStreet.com brought over 
$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent 
over the year-ago quarter.
ConsumerReports.com will 
reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.
RealNetworks' consumer multi-media 
subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 
million in the last quarter.
The Wall Street Journal Online
added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber
base to 646,000.
FT.com has signed up 17,000 
subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.
In recognition of this trend we're hosting 
the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 
2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free 
to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.
Our previous Content Management 
Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City 
and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.
The Content Management Summit 
III,  taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, 
2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and 
distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical 
solutions.
The event will feature presentations 
from software and services companies providing services
and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.
We're thrilled that 
Microsoft,  TeleKnowledge,  eMeta,  and Liquify will all be demonstrating 
their latest products and services.
The event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.
 These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges
facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since
the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  The panels will
feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive
question and answer session with the audience.
Among the round table topics will be:
Weblogs:  how they are affecting big media 
companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.
Financial news and information 
companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, 
and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.
Business information services 
such as Hoovers,  Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, 
 niche product launches and revenue streams.
Daily news/newspaper companies 
publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards
paid content and its implications,  among other issues.
Consumer and entertainment 
publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, 
 the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.
Join us on October 10th 
for this very important event.  If you are directly responsible 
for content management at a major content site you may qualify for 
a VIP ticket.  Please e-mail your request with your name,  title and bio to
invite@cmsummit.com.  If you are
with a software or services provider,  or anyone not directly responsible 
for the purchase of content management software or solutions,  you can purchase

 CNETÂ TECH1,007.43 Â 14.52Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.
Motorola Sees Profit Rebound 
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27% Apple meets lowered expectations 
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billionAnalysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49% HP, EMC storage systems to work better together

Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a ""strong buy"" rating on the computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer laptop buying.

Date: 2002-10-03T14:52:57-05:00So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like â€œyou 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devicesâ€? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But â€œbecause it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devicesâ€ is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

16721,"capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit , virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 , geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise , on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation . the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data . capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company . in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 . as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area . a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market . conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream . for additional information , visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

CNET Software and Internet
 Dear Readers,On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might. Find out more in our MSN 8.0 First
Take. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies
 
 
 This week in Internet ServicesEver heard of a type of lawsuit known as a cyberSLAPP? We hadn't either. A cyberSLAPP case
typically involves ""a person who has posted anonymous criticisms
of a corporation or public figure on the Internet,"" according to
a coalition of privacy groups who are fighting to stop the
practice. Find out more.
First Take: MSN 8.0 BetaRedmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof""s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?
First Take: ICQ Lite AlphaOne of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.Looking for a new DSL provider?The DSL Power Search makes it easier to find the perfect
broadband provider for your needs. With our search, you can
identify the DSL providers in your neighborhood, then compare
prices and plans to make sure your new connection meets with your
objectives without breaking your budget.Don't type that: Yahoo edits e-mailYahoo's filter hunts for words that could activate JavaScript,
then it replaces them.

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
rpm -e sendmail-devel. give that a go and it should work np. Phil,

( 3 ) representational issues ( i . e . , what kind of meaning representations should form the input to the generation algorithm ? ) ( 4 ) reversibility of grammars ( 5 ) differences in textual style or ` genre ' ( 6 ) psycholinguistic research relevant to computational natural language generation ( nlg ) ( 7 ) corpus - based work leading to insights relevant for computational nlg ( 8 ) issues of system / algorithm evaluation . practical issues : we welcome short ( i . e . , roughly 1000-1500 words ) electronic submissions ( send email to rodger . kibble @ itri . brighton . ac . uk ) on the theme of the workshop . submissions should be in postscript or plain ascii . please include "" esslli99 "" in the subject line of your message to make things easy for us . in accordance with the description of the workshop description , we encourage submissions about theoretical ( e . g . , formal semantic or psycholinguistic ) , applied , or corpus-based work , as long as the work is clearly relevant for nlg programs . no matter what they consider the main focus of their work , we ask authors to * stress relevance for nlg * in their submission ( and , later , in their presentation ) . this will ensure that all contributions will contain a common ` core ' , notwithstanding their differences in perspective . it is esslli 's practice to make sure that workshops go ahead only if there turns out to be a sufficient level of interest , based on quantity and quality of submissions . workshop speakers are required to register for the summer school ; however , workshop speakers will be able to register at a reduced rate to be determined by the organizing committee . limited funds are available to contribute to speakers ' expenses in exceptional circumstances . important dates : - first call for papers : 22 october 1998 - deadline for submissions of abstracts : 1 march 1999 - notification of acceptance : 1 may 1999 - workshop to be held : august 9-13 for any questions , please contact the organizers or consult our web page at < http : / / www . itri . brighton . ac . uk / projects / gnome / esslli99 . html > which will shortly be available . rodger kibble & kees van deemter information technology research institute ( itri ) university of brighton lewes road , watts building brighton bn2 4gj united kingdom email : rodger . kibble @ itri . brighton . ac . uk kees . van . deemter @ itri . brighton . ac . uk fax : + 44 1273 642908",0

The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).
